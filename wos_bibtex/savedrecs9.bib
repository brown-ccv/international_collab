Abstract = {{Objective: Since 2012, all community care recipients in New Zealand have
   undergone a standardised needs assessment using the Home Care
   International Residential Assessment Instrument (interRAI-HC). This
   study describes the national interRAI-HC population, assesses its data
   quality and evaluates its ability to be matched.
   Methods: The interRAI-HC instrument elicits information on 236 questions
   over 20 domains; conducted by 1,800+ trained health professionals.
   Assessments between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014 are reported here.
   Stratified by age, demographic characteristics were compared to 2013
   Census estimates and selected health profiles described. Deterministic
   matching to the Ministry of Health's mortality database was undertaken.
   Results: Overall, 51,232 interRAI-HC assessments were conducted, with
   47,714 (93.1\%) research consent from 47,236 unique individuals;
   including 2,675 Maori and 1,609 Pacific people. Apart from height and
   weight, data validity and reliability were high. A 99.8\% match to
   mortality data was achieved.
   Conclusions: The interRAI-HC research database is large and ethnically
   diverse, with high consent rates. Its generally good psychometric
   properties and ability to be matched enhances its research utility.
   Implications: This national database provides a remarkable opportunity
   for researchers to better understand older persons' health and health
   care, so as to better sustain older people in their own homes.}},

Title = {{The role of crystallization-driven exsolution on the sulfur mass balance

Abstract = {{The release of large amounts of sulfur to the stratosphere during
   explosive eruptions affects the radiative balance in the atmosphere and
   consequentially impacts climate for up to several years after the event.
   Quantitative estimations of the processes that control the mass balance
   of sulfur between melt, crystals, and vapor bubbles is needed to better
   understand the potential sulfur yield of individual eruption events and
   the conditions that favor large sulfur outputs to the atmosphere. The
   processes that control sulfur partitioning in magmas are (1) exsolution
   of volatiles (dominantly H2O) during decompression (first boiling) and
   during isobaric crystallization (second boiling), (2) the
   crystallization and breakdown of sulfide or sulfate phases in the magma,
   and (3) the transport of sulfur-rich vapor (gas influx) from deeper
   unerupted regions of the magma reservoir. Vapor exsolution and the
   formation/breakdown of sulfur-rich phases can all be considered as
   closed-system processes where mass balance arguments are generally
   easier to constrain, whereas the contribution of sulfur by vapor
   transport (open system process) is more difficult to quantify. The
   ubiquitous excess sulfur problem, which refers to the much higher sulfur
   mass released during eruptions than what can be accounted for by amount
   of sulfur originally dissolved in erupted melt, as estimated from melt
   inclusion sulfur concentrations (the petrologic estimate), reflects the
   challenges in closing the sulfur mass balance between crystals, melt,
   and vapor before and during a volcanic eruption. In this work, we try to
   quantify the relative importance of closed- and open-system processes
   for silicic arc volcanoes using kinetic models of sulfur partitioning
   during exsolution. Our calculations show that crystallization-induced
   exsolution (second boiling) can generate a significant fraction of the
   excess sulfur observed in crystal-rich arc magmas. This result does not
   negate the important role of vapor migration in sulfur mass balance but
   rather points out that second boiling (in situ exsolution) can provide
   the necessary yield to drive the excess sulfur to the levels observed
   for crystal-rich systems. In contrast, in crystal-poor systems, magma
   recharge that releases sulfur-rich bubbles is necessary and most likely
   the primary contributor to sulfur mass balance. Finally, we apply our
   model to account for the effect of sulfur partitioning during second
   boiling and its impact on sulfur released during the Cerro Galan
   supereruption in Argentina (2.08Ma) and show the potential importance of
   second boiling in releasing a large amount of sulfur to the atmosphere
   during the eruption of large crystal-rich ignimbrites.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine the association of maternal race/ethnicity only
   and parental race/ethnicity jointly with adverse birth outcomes (low
   birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm birth, and infant
   mortality) among New York City women.
   Methods. We used Bureau of Vital Statistics, New York City Department of
   Health and Mental Hygiene birth-and death-linked data from 2000 to 2010
   (n = 984 807) to quantify the association of maternal race/ethnicity and
   parental race/ethnicity concordance or discordance with each outcome.
   Results. By maternal race/ethnicity, infants of non-Hispanic Black,
   Hispanic, and Asian women had risks of adverse birth outcomes between
   10\% and 210\% greater than infants of non-Hispanic White women. Infants
   of non-Hispanic Black, Asian, and Hispanic couples exhibited higher risk
   of adverse birth outcomes than infants of non-Hispanic White couples.
   Moreover, parental racial/ethnic discordance was associated with an
   increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, with highest risks for
   pairings of Asian men with non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and
   Hispanic women, and of Asian women with non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic
   men.
   Conclusions. Parental race/ethnicity discordance may add stress to women
   during pregnancy, affecting birth outcomes. Thus, parental
   race/ethnicity should be considered when examining such outcomes.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We consider a one-dimensional model that describes the depinning of an
   elastic string of particles in a strongly pinning, phase-disordered
   periodic environment under a slowly increasing force. The evolution
   towards depinning occurs by the triggering of avalanches in regions of
   activity which are at first isolated, but later grow and merge. For
   large system sizes the dynamically critical behavior is dominated by the
   coagulation of these active regions. Our analysis and numerical
   simulations show that the evolution of the sizes of active regions is
   well described by a Smoluchowski coagulation equation, allowing us to
   predict correlation lengths and avalanche sizes in terms of certain
   moments of the size distribution. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2016}},

Abstract = {{N-of-1 trials provide a mechanism for making evidence-based treatment
   decisions for an individual patient. They use key methodological
   elements of group clinical trials to evaluate treatment effectiveness in
   a single patient, for situations that cannot always accommodate
   large-scale trials: rare diseases, comorbid conditions, or in patients
   using concurrent therapies. Improvement in the reporting and clarity of
   methods and findings in N-of-1 trials is essential for reader to gauge
   the validity of trials and to replicate successful findings. A
   Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for
   N-of-1 trials (CENT 2015) provides guidance on the reporting of
   individual and series of N-of-1 trials. CENT provides additional
   guidance for 14 of the 25 items of the CONSORT 2010 checklist,
   recommends a diagram for depicting an individual N-of-1 trial, and
   modifies the CONSORT flow diagram to address the flow of a series of
   N-of-1 trials. The rationale, development process, and CENT 2015
   checklist and diagrams are reported in this document. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate how data from n-of-1 trials may be used in
   systematic reviews and meta-analyses by examining the effects of
   amphetamine and methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD).
   Study Design and Setting: Electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
   PsychINFO for English language articles published from 1950 to 2013.
   N-of-1 trials of pediatric participants with ADHD that assessed either
   amphetamine or methylphenidate vs. placebo were included. The primary
   outcome was improvement of core symptoms of ADHD, which was assessed by
   multiple rating scales. Studies with obtainable individual participant
   data were included in the meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences were
   computed using a random-effects model.
   Results: Nine studies were included in the amphetamine-placebo
   comparison and 10 in the methylphenidate-placebo comparison.
   Meta-analyses were consistently in favor of amphetamine in 10 of 11 ADHD
   symptom domains and methylphenidate in 7 of 12 symptom domains. A high
   degree of heterogeneity across participant treatment response was
   observed.
   Conclusions: Meta-analysis of n-of-1 trials suggests that amphetamine
   and methylphenidate are effective treatments for pediatric ADHD.
   Synthesizing n-of-1 trials enables assessment of individual responses to
   treatment as well as aggregate summaries across individuals and studies.
   It offers a promising general approach with applications across diverse
   treatments and disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess how the inclusion of N-of-1 trial data into
   randomized controlled trial (RCT) meta-analyses impacts the magnitude
   and precision of yielded treatment effects, using amphetamines and
   methylphenidate for pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
   as a model.
   Study Design and Setting: We combined the N-of-1 and RCT data generated
   from previously conducted systematic reviews using parent and teacher
   ratings of hyperactivity and/or impulsivity as the outcome. Data were
   combined using standardized mean differences assuming a random effects
   model. The amphetamine and methylphenidate evidence were synthesized
   separately.
   Results: We found that the inclusion of N-of-1 trial data in the
   meta-analysis impacted both magnitude and precision. The addition of the
   N-of-1 trial data narrowed the confidence intervals in three of the four
   comparisons as compared to the treatment effect yielded by RCT-only
   data. Furthermore, the addition of N-of-1 trials changed the overall
   treatment effects yielded by the RCT-only meta-analyses from
   statistically nonsignificant to statistically significant in one of the
   four outcomes.
   Conclusions: If the overall goal of a meta-analysis is to synthesize all
   available evidence on a given topic, then N-of-1 trials should be
   included. This study shows it is possible to combine N-of-1 trial data
   with RCT data and the potential merits of this approach. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Objective: To provide the first head-to-head test of the predictive
   validity of 2 resolution levels included in the current consensus
   definition of major depressive episode (MDE) recovery and provide an
   empirically based, clinically useful definition of the end of an MDE.
   Method: 322 participants entering the National Institute of Mental
   Health Collaborative Depression Study with MDE (diagnosed by Research
   Diagnostic Criteria) in 1978-1981, and followed thereafter for up to 31
   years, were divided into those with 8 consecutive weeks of asymptomatic
   MDE recovery or residual subsyndromal depressive symptom (SSD)
   resolution of their index MDE. These 2 levels of recovery were defined
   based on weekly symptom status on all depressive conditions, assessed by
   Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation (LIFE) interviews conducted
   every 6 months. Primary measures of validity of these 2 alternative
   definitions were first well interval duration and long-term depressive
   illness burden. Groups were also compared on clinical variables,
   antidepressant treatment, and psychosocial function.
   Results: 61.2\% of subjects recovered asymptomatically from their index
   MDE. By survival analysis, they remained free of a depressive episode
   relapse or recurrence 4.2 times longer than those with SSD resolution
   (median = 135 vs 32 weeks; X-2 = 70.65; P < .0001). This was not
   attributable to a difference in intensity of antidepressant medication.
   Compared to asymptomatic recovery, SSD resolution was associated with
   significantly longer and more severe index MDEs, with more miscellaneous
   psychopathology as well as increased long-term psychosocial dysfunction
   and a greater depressive illness burden during the ensuing 10 or 20
   years. Asymptomatic MDE resolution was a stronger predictor of time well
   than any of 18 other predictors, singly or combined. Eight consecutive
   weeks of asymptomatic recovery had 93\% overlap with a 4-week definition
   and conferred little benefit over 4 weeks.
   Conclusions: Four consecutive weeks of asymptomatic recovery defines the
   end of an MDE and the beginning of a stable well state with improved
   psychosocial function. Residual symptom resolution is a continuation of
   an active state of the episode, not the end of an MDE.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-dictated
   nuclear exclusion and degradation of Nrf2 is pivotal in switching off
   the self-protective antioxidant stress response after injury. Here, we
   examined the mechanisms underlying this regulation in glomerular
   disease. In primary podocytes, doxorubicin elicited cell death and actin
   cytoskeleton disorganization, concomitant with overactivation of GSK3
   beta (the predominant GSK3 isoform expressed in glomerular podocytes)
   and minimal Nrf2 activation. SB216763, a highly selective small molecule
   inhibitor of GSK3, exerted a protective effect that depended on the
   potentiated Nrf2 antioxidant response, marked by increased Nrf2
   expression and nuclear accumulation and augmented production of the Nrf2
   target heme oxygenase-1. Ectopic expression of the kinase-dead mutant of
   GSK3 beta in cultured podocytes reinforced the doxorubicin-induced Nrf2
   activation and prevented podocyte injury. Conversely, a constitutively
   active GSK3 beta mutant blunted the doxorubicin-induced Nrf2 response
   and exacerbated podocyte injury, which could be abolished by treatment
   with SB216763. In murine models of doxorubicin nephropathy or
   nephrotoxic serum nephritis, genetic targeting of GSK3 beta by
   doxycycline-inducible podocyte-specific knockout or pharmacologic
   targeting by SB216763 significantly attenuated albuminuria and
   ameliorated histologic signs of podocyte injury, including
   podocytopenia, loss of podocyte markers, podocyte de novo expression of
   desmin, and ultrastructural lesions of podocytopathy (such as foot
   process effacement). This beneficial outcome was likely attributable to
   an enhanced Nrf2 antioxidant response in glomerular podocytes because
   the selective Nrf2 antagonist trigonelline abolished the
   proteinuria-reducing and podocyte-protective effect. Collectively, our
   results suggest the GSK3 beta-regulated Nrf2 antioxidant response as a
   novel therapeutic target for protecting podocytes and treating
   proteinuric glomerulopathies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Chromosomal translocations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
   (ALK) gene have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung
   adenocarcinomas and other tumors, recently including rare cases of
   colorectal carcinoma. We identified a patient with refractory metastatic
   colorectal carcinoma harboring a STRN-ALK gene fusion who achieved an
   exceptional clinical benefit to the ALK inhibitor ceritinib. Our goal
   was to further define the clinicopathologic features of ALK-rearranged
   colorectal carcinoma in a large cohort.
   Experimental Design: Clinical cases of colorectal carcinoma evaluated by
   comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) or by ALK immunohistochemistry
   (IHC) were reviewed retrospectively. FISHandmicrosatellite
   instability(MSI) analyses were performed.
   Results: Nine colorectal carcinoma cases harbored ALK gene fusions. Six
   cases were identified by CGP of 3,157 colorectal carcinoma (0.2\%) and
   three by IHC of 2,980 colorectal carcinoma (0.1\%). The ALK fusions
   involved known ALK partners EML4, C2orf44, CAD, and the novel STRN,
   PPP1R21, SENPF, MAPRE3, and PRKAP1B partners. These advanced-stage
   colorectal carcinomas lacked mutations in other oncogenic drivers,
   predominantly involved the proximal colon, and often exhibited MSI and
   mucinous phenotype. The index patient was treated with the ALK inhibitor
   ceritinib, resulting in a marked decrease in size of a skin metastasis,
   and resolution by computerized tomography of all contrast enhancing
   tumor. After 9 months of treatment, biopsy of progressive disease
   demonstrated a KRAS mutation, consistent with acquired resistance to
   ceritinib.
   Conclusions: Colorectal carcinoma harboring ALK fusions represent a rare
   aggressive subtype of colorectal carcinoma with distinct
   clinicopathologic features. This report provides the first clinical
   evidence that such patients may benefit from targeted monotherapywith
   ALK inhibitors. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an effective seismic denoising method using
   directional total variation (DTV) in the shearlet domain. This approach
   exploits the sparseness of shearlet transform and direction sensitivity
   of DTV. Shearlet shrinkage has a positive effect on denoising, but
   suffers from Gibbs artifact which can be solved by total variation (TV).
   DTV is an improved method of TV using anisotropic projection and
   performs well for the noisy signal with a dominant direction. The
   seismic data can be decomposed into several subbands by shearlet
   transform. Every subband has its own dominant direction. Therefore
   applying the direction information to DTV can more effectively eliminate
   seismic noise. The application on synthetic data and field data shows
   that the proposed method is superior to shearlet transform or DTV in
   seismogram noise removal and feature preservation.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the acceptability, feasibility, and initial efficacy
   of an expanded version of a PTSD treatment developed for residents of
   battered women's shelters, Helping to Overcome PTSD through Empowerment
   (HOPE) in women who received standard shelter services (SSSs). A Phase I
   randomized clinical trial comparing HOPE + SSSs (n = 30) to SSSs (n =
   30) was conducted. Primary outcome measures included the
   Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (Blake etal., 1995) and the Revised
   Conflict Tactic Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, \& Sugarman, ).
   Participants were followed at 1-week, and 3- and 6-months posttreatment.
   Only 2 women dropped out of HOPE + SSS treatment. Latent growth curve
   analyses found significant treatment effects for PTSD from intimate
   partner violence (IPV) ( = -.007, p = .021), but not for future IPV ( =
   .002, p = .709) across follow-up points. Significant effects were also
   found for secondary outcomes of depression severity ( = -.006, p =
   .052), empowerment ( = .155, p = .022), and resource gain ( = .158, p =
   .036). Additionally, more women in HOPE + SSSs were employed at 3- and
   6-month follow-up compared to those in SSSs only. Results showed the
   acceptability and feasibility of adding IPV-related treatment to
   standard services. They also suggested that HOPE may be a promising
   treatment for residents of battered women's shelters. Further research
   with a larger sample, utilizing more diverse shelter settings and a more
   rigorous control condition, is needed to confirm these findings.}},

   interfaces}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Interfaces are essential in electrochemical processes, providing a
   critical nanoscopic design feature for composite electrodes used in
   Li-ion batteries. Understanding the structure, wetting and mobility at
   nano-confined interfaces is important for improving the efficiency and
   lifetime of electrochemical devices. Here we use a Surface Forces
   Apparatus to quantify the initial wetting of nanometre-confined
   graphene, gold and mica surfaces by Li-ion battery electrolytes. Our
   results indicate preferential wetting of confined graphene in comparison
   with gold or mica surfaces because of specific interactions of the
   electrolyte with the graphene surface. In addition, wetting of a
   confined pore proceeds via a profoundly different mechanism compared
   with wetting of a macroscopic surface. We further reveal the existence
   of molecularly layered structures of the confined electrolyte.
   Nanoscopic confinement of less than 4-5 nm and the presence of water
   decrease the mobility of the electrolyte. These results suggest a lower
   limit for the pore diameter in nanostructured electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Immunization of pregnant women against influenza has the potential to
   reduce adverse fetal outcomes by reducing prenatal exposure to influenza
   illness. However, as touched on by Fell et al. (Am J Epidemiol.
   2016;184(3):163-175) and Vazquez-Benitez et al. (Am J Epidemiol.
   2016;184(3):176-186) in this issue of the Journal, observational studies
   in which the causal effect of maternal influenza illness and influenza
   immunization on fetal health are evaluated are prone to bias because of
   the complex temporal nature of influenza illness seasonality, influenza
   immunization schedules, and gestation itself. Immortal time bias is
   introduced by an ``anytime-in-pregnancy{''} exposure definition because
   the shortened pregnancy duration associated with many adverse fetal
   outcomes limits the opportunity to become exposed, whereas including
   follow-up time during which pregnancies are no longer at risk of an
   adverse outcome (e.g., gestational time after 37 weeks in studies of
   preterm birth) can lead to overestimation of any true benefits of
   immunization (or harms from influenza illness). We present a framework
   to avoid time-related biases in the study of influenza illness and
   immunization in pregnancy and advise that investigations of fetal
   benefit from maternal influenza immunization should only be undertaken
   when information is available on the calendar time of influenza virus
   circulation and the gestational age at which maternal influenza
   immunization occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal influenza vaccination prevents influenza illness in both
   mothers and newborns. Results from some recent studies have suggested
   that influenza vaccination might also prevent adverse pregnancy
   outcomes, such as preterm birth. However, it is challenging to conduct
   epidemiologic studies to evaluate the benefits to the fetus of maternal
   influenza vaccination because the causal benefit of vaccination is
   likely only experienced by the small fraction of the cohort in whom
   influenza illness is prevented by vaccination. The plausibility of
   detecting true differences in risks between groups under such conditions
   is rarely discussed. We aimed to inform the interpretation of studies in
   which the fetal benefits of maternal influenza vaccination are evaluated
   by estimating detectable risk ratios and necessary sample sizes for
   different study scenarios. Estimates of rates of influenza illness,
   vaccine effectiveness, vaccine uptake, and preterm birth and of the
   association of influenza illness with preterm birth were identified from
   the published literature. We calculated detectable risk ratios for
   preterm birth in vaccinated versus unvaccinated women and the associated
   sample size requirements. Our results demonstrated that under most
   scenarios, plausible differences between groups will be extremely
   challenging to detect (risk ratios for preterm birth of 0.9 to 1.0) and
   will require sample sizes infeasible for prospective epidemiologic
   research. This suggests that the large fetal benefits from influenza
   vaccination observed in epidemiologic studies are unlikely to be causal.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the bases of residential segregation in a late
   nineteenth century American city, recognizing the strong tendency toward
   homophily within neighborhoods. Our primary question is how ethnicity,
   social class, nativity, and family composition affect where people live.
   Segregation is usually studied one dimension at a time, but these social
   differences are interrelated, and thus a multivariate approach is needed
   to understand their effects. We find that ethnicity is the main basis of
   local residential sorting, while occupational standing and, to a lesser
   degree, family life cycle and nativity also are significant. A second
   concern is the geographic scale of neighborhoods: in this study, the
   geographic area within which the characteristics of potential neighbors
   matter in locational outcomes of individuals. Studies of segregation
   typically use a single spatial scale, often one determined by the
   availability of administrative data. We take advantage of a unique data
   set containing the address and geo-referenced location of every
   resident. We conclude that it is the most local scale that offers the
   best prediction of people's similarity to their neighbors. Adding
   information at larger scales minimally improves prediction of the
   person's location. The 1880 neighborhoods of Newark, New Jersey, were
   formed as individuals located themselves among similar neighbors on a
   single street segment.}},

Abstract = {{The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans can reversibly switch between
   two cell types named white and opaque, each of which is stable through
   many cell divisions. These two cell types differ in their ability to
   mate, their metabolic preferences and their interactions with the
   mammalian innate immune system. A highly interconnected network of eight
   transcriptional regulators has been shown to control switching between
   these two cell types. To identify additional regulators of the switch,
   we systematically and quantitatively measured white-opaque switching
   rates of 196 strains, each deleted for a specific transcriptional
   regulator. We identified 19 new regulators with at least a 10-fold
   effect on switching rates and an additional 14 new regulators with more
   subtle effects. To investigate how these regulators affect switching
   rates, we examined several criteria, including the binding of the eight
   known regulators of switching to the control region of each new
   regulatory gene, differential expression of the newly found genes
   between cell types, and the growth rate of each mutant strain. This
   study highlights the complexity of the transcriptional network that
   regulates the white-opaque switch and the extent to which switching is
   linked to a variety of metabolic processes, including respiration and
   carbon utilization. In addition to revealing specific insights, the
   information reported here provides a foundation to understand the highly
   complex coupling of white-opaque switching to cellular physiology.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of atomistic simulations depends decisively on the accuracy
   of the underlying energy function (force field). Of particular
   importance for condensed-phase properties are nonbonded interactions,
   including the electrostatic and Lennard-Jones terms. Permanent atomic
   multipoles (MTPs) are an extension to common point-charge (PC)
   representations in atomistic simulations. MTPs are commonly determined
   from and fitted to an ab initio Electrostatic Potential (ESP), and
   Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters are obtained from comparison of
   experimental and computed observables using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. For this a set of thermodynamic observables such as
   density, heat of vaporization, and hydration free energy is chosen, to
   which the parametrization is fitted. The current work introduces a
   comprehensive computing environment (Fitting Wizard (FW)) for optimizing
   nonbonded interactions for atomistic force fields of different
   qualities. The FW supports fitting of standard PC-based force fields and
   more physically motivated multipolar (MTP) force fields. A broader study
   including 20 molecules ranging from N-methyl-acetamide and benzene to
   halogenated benzenes, phenols, anilines, and pyridines yields a root
   mean squared deviation for hydration free energies of 0.36 kcal/mol over
   a range of 8 kcal/mol. It is furthermore shown that PC-based force
   fields are not necessarily inferior compared to MTP parametrizations
   depending on the molecule considered.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2893-2902}},

Abstract = {{Joints that have degenerated as a result of aging or injury contain dead
   chondrocytes and damaged cartilage. Some studies have suggested that
   chondrocyte death precedes cartilage damage, but how the loss of
   chondrocytes affects cartilage integrity is not clear. In this study, we
   examined whether chondrocyte death undermines cartilage integrity in
   aging and injury using a rapid 3D confocal cartilage imaging technique
   coupled with standard histology. We induced autonomous expression of
   diphtheria toxin to kill articular surface chondrocytes in mice and
   determined that chondrocyte death did not lead to cartilage damage.
   Moreover, cartilage damage after surgical destabilization of the medial
   meniscus of the knee was increased in mice with intact chondrocytes
   compared with animals whose chondrocytes had been killed, suggesting
   that chondrocyte death does not drive cartilage damage in response to
   injury. These data imply that chondrocyte catabolism, not death,
   contributes to articular cartilage damage following injury. Therefore,
   therapies targeted at reducing the catabolic phenotype may protect
   against degenerative joint disease.}},

   theories}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR PHYSICS B}},

Volume = {{909}},
Pages = {{980-1019}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Electric magnetic dualities are equivalence between strong and weak
   coupling constants. A standard example is the exchange of electric and
   magnetic fields in an abelian gauge theory. We show three methods to
   perform electric magnetic dualities in the case of the non-commutative
   U(1) gauge theory. The first method is to use covariant field strengths
   to be the electric and magnetic fields. We find an invariant form of an
   equation of motion after performing the electric magnetic duality. The
   second method is to use the Seiberg-Witten map to rewrite the
   non-commutative U(1) gauge theory in terms of abelian field strength.
   The third method is to use the large Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz (NS-NS)
   background limit (non-commutativity parameter only has one degree of
   freedom) to consider the non-commutative U(1) gauge theory or D3-brane.
   In this limit, we introduce or dualize a new one-form gauge potential to
   get a D3-brane in a large Ramond-Ramond (R-R) background via field
   redefinition. We also use perturbation to study the equivalence between
   two D3-brane theories. Comparison of these methods in the
   non-commutative U (1) gauge theory gives different physical
   implications. The comparison reflects the differences between the
   non-abelian and non-commutative gauge theories in the electric magnetic
   dualities. For a complete study, we also extend our studies to the
   simplest abelian and non-abelian p-form gauge theories, and a
   non-commutative theory with the non-abelian structure. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The circumscription of Molluginaceae has changed radically in recent
   years, with Corbichonia being moved to Lophiocarpaceae, Limeum to
   Limeaceae, Macarthuria to Macarthuriaceae and all species of Hypertelis,
   except the type, to Kewa in Kewaceae. In a broad analysis of core
   Caryophyllales using plastid trnK-matK and rbcL, sequences, the position
   of Molluginaceae in a strict sense as sister to the Portulacineae Glade
   is corroborated, as are the positions of Corbichonia, Limeum and Kewa
   outside the family. The phylogeny of Molluginaceae is reconstructed
   based on trnK-matK and nuclear ITS sequences of about half of the
   currently recognized species in the family and with representatives from
   all recognized genera. Mollugo is found to be polyphyletic and a new
   taxonomy for the family with 11 genera is proposed. Mollugo in its new
   restricted sense is a mainly American genus of about 15 species,
   including M. ulei comb. nov., previously placed in the monotypic
   Glischrothamnus. The Australian and Asian genus Trigastrotheca is
   resurrected for T. molluginea, T. pentaphylla comb. nov. and T. stricta
   comb. nov. The name Paramollugo nom. nov. is proposed for the Mollugo
   nudicaulis group and the combinations P. angustifolia comb. nov., P.
   cuneifolia comb. nov., P. decandra comb. nov., P. deltoidea comb. nov.,
   P. navassensis comb. nov. and P. nudicaulis comb. nov. are made.
   Hypertelis is expanded to include, besides the type H. spergulacea, also
   H. cerviana comb. nov., H. fragilis comb. nov., H. umbellata comb. nov.
   and H. walteri comb. nov. In Pharnaceum, the new combination P.
   namaquense comb. nov. is made, Hypertelis longifolia is treated as a
   synonym of P. lineare and Mollugo tenella as a synonym of P. subtile.
   Corbichonia is proposed to be treated as a family of its own,
   Corbichoniaceae fam. nov. Several names are lectotypified, including the
   Linnaean Mollugo pentaphylla and M stricta. An anthocyanin is reported
   for the first time from Simmondsiaceae. The detection of anthocyanins in
   members of Kewaceae and Molluginaceae agree with previous reports and
   corroborate the view that these families represent reversals from
   betalains to anthocyanins. The report of an anthocyanin in Limeaceae,
   previously regarded as unpigmented, apparently represents a newly
   detected reversal from betalains to anthocyanins in this family.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Whether or which blood heavy metal levels (BHMLs) influence
   elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) are unknown. We examined the
   relationship among blood lead, mercury, and cadmium levels, blood
   pressure (BP), and MP and assessed whether BP mediates these BHMLs-lOP
   associations.
   Methods: We analyzed data on 8371 adult (>= 20 years) from the Korea
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2012.
   Mediation analysis was used to examine the contribution of BP to the
   BHMLs-IOP relationship.
   Results: IOP and three BHMLs were significantly associated with systolic
   and diastolic BP. But IOP was associated with only blood lead and
   mercury levels. BP significantly mediated lead-IOP and mercury-IOP
   associations: BP accounted for 20.5\% and 14.2\% of the association with
   IOP. Blood lead and mercury levels were significantly associated with
   IOP.
   Conclusions: BP significantly mediates the effects of those blood lead
   and mercury levels on IOP outcome. Prospective studies are needed to
   further examine the causal pathway from BHMLs to IOP elevation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Purpose: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly prevalent among correctional
   populations. We aimed to explore racial and ethnic disparities in
   hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) prevalence in U.S. correctional
   populations.
   Methods: We systematically searched the literature for reports of
   anti-HCV prevalence among U.S. jail and prison populations, by race and
   ethnicity. We calculated summary prevalence estimates for non-Hispanic
   White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and ``Other{''} race/ethnicity jail
   detainees and prisoners and determined the proportion of anti-HCV
   positive persons from racial ethnic minority backgrounds.
   Results: Few studies reported anti-HCV prevalence data by race and
   ethnicity, and they suffered from methodologic weaknesses. Anti-HCV
   prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic Whites (35\% {[}95\% CI: 28\%,
   43\%; k = 9], compared to 26\% {[}95\% CI: 21\%, 32\%; k = 10] among
   racial and ethnic minorities). However, the majority (63\%) of persons
   with anti-HCV were from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds.
   Conclusions: Racial and ethnic minority persons appear to comprise the
   majority of HCV burden in U.S. correctional settings. Universal
   screening and treatment of HCV infection in correctional settings may
   impact on community-level health disparities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objective: We sought to examine the clinical and electrographic
   differences between patients with combined epileptic (ES) and
   psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and age- and gender-matched
   patients with ES-only and PNES-only.
   Methods: Data from 138 patients (105 women {[}77\%]), including 46 with
   PNES/ES (39 +/- 12 years), 46 with PNES-only (39 +/- 11 years), and 46
   with ES-only (39 +/- 11 years), were compared using logistic regression
   analysis after adjusting for clustering effect.
   Results: In the cohort with PNES/ES, ES antedated PNES in 28 patients
   (70\%) and occurred simultaneously in 11 (27.5\%), while PNES were the
   initial presentation in only 1 case (2.5\%); disease duration was
   undetermined in 6. Compared with those with ES-only, patients with
   PNES/ES had higher depression and anxiety scores, shorter-duration
   electrographic seizures, less ES absence/staring semiology (all p <=
   0.01), and more ES arising in the right hemisphere, both in isolation
   and in combination with contralateral brain regions (61\% vs. 41\%; p =
   0.024, adjusted for anxiety and depression) and tended to have less ES
   arising in the left temporal lobe (13\% vs. 28\%; p = 0.054). Compared
   with those with PNES-only, patients with PNES/ES tended to show fewer
   right-hemibody PNES events (7\% vs. 23\%; p = 0.054) and more myoclonic
   semiology (10\% vs. 2\%; p = 0.073).
   Conclusions: Right-hemispheric electrographic seizures may be more
   common among patients with ES who develop comorbid PNES, in agreement
   with prior neurobiological studies on functional neurological disorders.

Abstract = {{In the lung, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is developmentally regulated, with
   its highest expression in the first days of life. In addition, neonatal
   mice have limited HO-1 induction in hyperoxia compared with adults.
   However, few reports have addressed the functional effect of microRNAs
   (miRNAs) in the regulation of HO-1 in vivo. The aims of the present
   study were to characterize changes in lung miRNA expression during
   postnatal development and in response to hyperoxic exposure, and to
   identify miRNAs that target lung HO-1 gene expression. Neonatal (<12 h
   old) and adult (2 mo old) mice were exposed to room air or hyperoxia
   (95\% oxygen) for 72 h. TaqMan low-density array rodent miRNA assays
   were used to calculate miRNA expression changes between control and
   hyperoxia groups in neonatal and adult lungs. In neonates, we identified
   miR-196a, which binds to the 3'-untranslated region of the
   transcriptional repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) and regulates
   its expression, and subsequently leads to higher levels of lung HO-1
   mRNA compared with levels in adults. Despite the increase at baseline,
   miR-196a was degraded in hyperoxia resulting in limited HO-1 induction
   in neonatal mice lungs. Furthermore, the developmental differences in
   lung HO-1 gene expression can be explained in part by the variation in
   miRNA-196a and its effect on Bach1. This report is the first to show
   developmental differences in lung miR-196a and its effect on Bach1 and
   HO-1 expression at baseline and in hyperoxia.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging HIV epidemic can be seen among men who have sex with men
   (MSM) in Vietnam. There are currently no evidence-based behavioral
   sexual risk reduction interventions for MSM in this setting. Between
   October 2012 and June 2013, 100 high-risk MSM from Ho Chi Minh City were
   enrolled in an open pilot trial to assess feasibility and acceptability
   of a group based, manualized sexual risk reduction intervention, and to
   preliminarily examine changes in primary and secondary outcomes.
   Participants completed a behavioral assessment battery and HIV testing
   at baseline, 3, and 6 months post -baseline. Over 80.0 \% of the sample
   was <25 years old and 77.0 \% identified as Bong kin ({''}hidden,{''}
   masculine-appearing). Feasibility and acceptability of the program was
   evidenced by 87.0 \% retention for the intervention sessions, 78.0 \%
   completion of the 6 month assessment, and positive responses on
   evaluation forms and qualitative exit interviews. There was a decline in
   the number of condomless anal sex acts from baseline (6.32) to 3 month
   (2.06) and 6 month (2.49) follow-up (p <.0001). These data support the

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that coinhibitory receptors appear to be
   important in contributing sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Our
   laboratory reported that mice deficient in programmed cell death
   receptor (PD)-1 have increased bacterial clearance and improved survival
   in experimental sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In
   response to infection, the liver clears the blood of bacteria and
   produces cytokines. Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages in the
   liver, are strategically situated to perform the above functions.
   However, it is not known if PD-1 expression on Kupffer cells is altered
   by septic stimuli, let alone if PD-1 ligation contributes to the altered
   microbial handling seen. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly
   upregulated on Kupffer cells during sepsis. PD-1-deficient septic mouse
   Kupffer cells displayed markedly enhanced phagocytosis and restoration
   of the expression of major histocompatibility complex II and CD86, but
   reduced CD80 expression compared with septic wild-type (WT) mouse
   Kupffer cells. In response to ex vivo LPS stimulation, the cytokine
   productive capacity of Kupffer cells derived from PD-1-/- CLP mice
   exhibited a marked, albeit partial, restoration of the release of IL-6,
   IL-12, IL-1 beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IL-10 compared
   with septic WT mouse Kupffer cells. In addition, PD-1 gene deficiency
   decreased LPS-induced apoptosis of septic Kupffer cells, as indicated by
   decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and reduced terminal
   deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling-positive cells.
   Exploring the signal pathways involved, we found that, after ex vivo LPS
   stimulation, septic PD-1-/- mouse Kupffer cells exhibited an increased
   Akt phosphorylation and a reduced p38 phosphorylation compared with
   septic WT mouse Kupffer cells. Together, these results indicate that
   PD-1 appears to play an important role in regulating the development of
   Kupffer cell dysfunction seen in sepsis.}},

Abstract = {{With respect to its large size and abundance, Eryops is an important
   representative of Permo-Carboniferous basal tetrapods and one of the
   best-known large temnospondyl amphibians of this period. This taxon
   forms a significant component of the Early Permian tetrapod fauna of
   Texas and New Mexico and here we describe a new record of skull remains,
   the first one from Brushy Creek (30 km northeast of Seymour) in Texas
   (Petrolia Formation, Wichita Group; Lower Permian - lower Artinskian).
   Our material, found in 2015, consists of a left nasal, a jaw fragment
   (premaxilla or maxilla), left quadratojugal fragments, and a partial
   left mandible. We used computed tomography methods (micro-CT) for
   imaging both internal and external structures, for the first time, for
   Eryops. The quadratojugal presented here is exceptional compared to all
   known basal tetrapods in having four different internal foramina. CT
   data show that these foramina are interconnected by canals within the
   bone. This indicates that the morphology of the foramina and the course
   of the canals in the quadratojugal of basal tetrapods are more variable
   than hitherto thought. Anat Rec, 299:1073-1079, 2016. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{The effect of menstrual cycle phase on sleep has been studied for
   decades; however, individual differences in the associations between
   sleep and menstrual phase have not been well studied. In addition, the
   associations between changes in sleep and other physiological and
   psychological factors that vary as a function of menstrual phase have
   not been thoroughly assessed. This study explored individual differences
   in daily self-reports of difficulty sleeping across the menstrual cycle,
   as well as associations between daily changes in difficulty sleeping and
   psychological/vegetative and somatic symptoms. Participants (n = 213
   females, mean age = 21.29 +/- 4.01 years) completed daily online
   questionnaires assessing` sleep, psychological and physical symptoms for
   two menstrual cycles. Two patterns of menstrual cycle-related
   self-reported difficulty sleeping emerged in addition to women who
   showed no cyclical change in self-reported difficulty sleeping: a
   perimenstrual increase and a mid-cycle increase. All
   psychological/vegetative symptoms and some of the somatic symptoms
   showed significant associations with self-reported difficulty sleeping.
   These findings highlight the importance of examining individual
   differences in sleep across the menstrual cycle and the significant
   contribution of a wide range of menstrual cycle-related
   psychological/vegetative and somatic symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurea, a promising material for damage mitigation in impact
   scenarios, has been investigated through plane-wave, pressure-shear
   plate impact (PSPI) experiments to obtain its mechanical response at

   results, a physically-based, quasi-linear, viscoelasticity model is
   introduced to capture the observed nonlinear pressure-volume behavior,
   the strong dependence of shearing resistance on pressure, and the strong
   relaxation of deviatoric stresses. This model has been implemented in
   finite element software ABAQUS to simulate the response of polyurea
   P1000 under the impact conditions of a variety of PSPI experiments.
   Simulation results agree reasonably well with those of the experiments.

Title = {{Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination A Simple and

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Patients with large vessel occlusion strokes
   (LVOS) may be better served by direct transfer to endovascular capable
   centers avoiding hazardous delays between primary and comprehensive
   stroke centers. However, accurate stroke field triage remains
   challenging. We aimed to develop a simple field scale to identify LVOS.
   Methods-The Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination
   (FAST-ED) scale was based on items of the National Institutes of Health
   Stroke Scale (NIHSS) with higher predictive value for LVOS and tested in
   the Screening Technology and Outcomes Project in Stroke (STOPStroke)
   cohort, in which patients underwent computed tomographic angiography
   within the first 24 hours of stroke onset. LVOS were defined by total
   occlusions involving the intracranial internal carotid artery, middle
   cerebral artery-M1, middle cerebral artery-2, or basilar arteries.
   Patients with partial, bihemispheric, and anterior+posterior circulation
   occlusions were excluded. Receiver operating characteristic curve,
   sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
   predictive value of FAST-ED were compared with the NIHSS, Rapid Arterial
   Occlusion Evaluation (RACE) scale, and Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke
   Severity (CPSS) scale.
   Results-LVO was detected in 240 of the 727 qualifying patients (33\%).
   FAST-ED had comparable accuracy to predict LVO to the NIHSS and higher
   accuracy than RACE and CPSS (area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve: FAST-ED=0.81 as reference; NIHSS=0.80, P=0.28;
   RACE=0.77, P=0.02; and CPSS=0.75, P=0.002). A FAST-ED >= 4 had
   sensitivity of 0.60, specificity of 0.89, positive predictive value of
   0.72, and negative predictive value of 0.82 versus RACE >= 5 of 0.55,
   0.87, 0.68, and 0.79, and CPSS >= 2 of 0.56, 0.85, 0.65, and 0.78,
   respectively.
   Conclusions-FAST-ED is a simple scale that if successfully validated in
   the field, it may be used by medical emergency professionals to identify
   LVOS in the prehospital setting enabling rapid triage of patients.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTo counteract the syndemics of HIV and alcohol in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, international collaborations have developed interventions to
   reduce alcohol consumption. Reliable and accurate methods are needed to
   estimate alcohol use outcomes. A direct alcohol biomarker called
   phosphatidylethanol (PEth) has been shown to validate heavy, daily
   drinking, but the literature indicates mixed results for moderate and
   nondaily drinkers, including among HIV-infected populations. This study
   examined the associations of the PEth biomarker with self-report alcohol
   use at 2 time points in 127 HIV-infected outpatient drinkers in western
   Kenya.
   MethodsParticipants were consecutively enrolled in a randomized clinical
   trial to test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to reduce
   alcohol use in Eldoret, Kenya. They endorsed current alcohol use, and a
   minimum score of 3 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
   Test-Consumption or consuming 6 drinks per occasion at least monthly in
   the past year. Study interviews and blood draws were conducted at
   baseline and at 3months post treatment from July 2012 through September
   2013. Alcohol use was assessed using the Timeline Followback
   questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for the presence of the PEth
   biomarker and were compared to self-reported alcohol use. We also
   conducted semistructured interviews with 14 study completers in February
   through March 2014.
   ResultsBaseline data indicated an average of moderate-heavy alcohol use:
   50\% drinking days and a median of 4.5 drinks per drinking day. At
   baseline, 46\% of women (31 of 67) and 8\% of men (5 of 60) tested
   negative for PEth (p<0.001). At the 3-month follow-up, 93\% of women (25
   of 27) and 97\% of men (30 of 31) who reported drinking tested positive,
   while 70\% of women (28 of 40) and 35\% of men (10 of 29) who denied
   drinking tested negative for PEth. Interviews were consistent with
   self-reported alcohol use among 13 individuals with negative baseline
   results.
   ConclusionsThese results add to the growing literature showing lack of
   agreement between self-report and PEth results among unhealthy and
   nondaily drinkers, particularly women. More research is needed to
   determine at what level of consumption over what period of time PEth
   becomes a reliable and accurate indicator of alcohol use.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR) of both bare-metal
   stent (BMS) and drug-eluting stent (DES) is currently unclear. The aim
   of this meta-analysis was to assess the role of drug-eluting balloon
   (DEB) as an optional treatment for ISR. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE,
   EMBASE, BIOS, and Web of Science from 2005 to July 2014. Eight studies,
   enrolling 1413 patients were included. Main end points were late lumen
   loss (LLL), binary in-segment restenosis (BR), major adverse cardiac
   events (MACEs), target lesion revascularization (TLR), death, myocardial
   infarction (MI), and stent thrombosis (ST). When compared to plain old
   balloon angioplasty (POBA), DEB treatment significantly reduced the risk
   of MACE (risk rato {[}RR] 0.37, P < .01), death (RR 0.44, P = .04), TLR
   (RR 0.27, P < .01), BR (RR {[}95\% CI]: 0.23{[}0.12 to 0.43], P < .01)
   and associated with better outcomes of LLL ( 0.50 {[} 0.65 to 0.35] mm,
   P < .01). However, the differences were not significant between DEB
   treatment and DES treatment in all primary and secondary end points. The
   DEB was a better option to treat ISR when compared to POBA. However, it
   had similar effects as DES.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study is to evaluate, by ultrasonography
   (US), the prevalence in the quadriceps, patellar, and Achilles tendon
   involvement of gout compared to that of patients with osteoarthritis and
   asymptomatic marathon runners. This is a multicenter, multinational,
   transverse cross-sectional, and comparative study comprising 80 patients
   with the diagnosis of gout according to the American College of
   Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, compared with two control groups: 35
   patients with generalized osteoarthritis according to the ACR criteria
   and 35 subjects who were healthy marathon runners. Demographics and
   clinical characteristics, such as age, gender, comorbidity, disease
   duration, pain at the enthesis in the knee and ankle, frequency of
   disease exacerbations, uric acid level more than 7.2 mg at the time of
   evaluation, and type of treatment, were recorded. All participants were
   examined by ultrasound at the quadriceps, the patellar at its proximal
   and distal insertion, and the Achilles tendon to detect intra-tendinous
   tophus or aggregates according to the OMERACT definitions. Descriptive
   statistics and differences between groups were analyzed by chi-square
   test. Sensitivity and specificity by US were calculated. The prevalence
   of intra-tendinous aggregates and tophi in gout was significant compared
   with the other groups. Both lesions were the most frequent at the distal
   patellar insertion, followed by the quadriceps, Achilles, and proximal
   patellar insertion ones. In patients with osteoarthritis (OA),
   intra-tendinous hyperechoic aggregates were observed in 20 \% of
   quadriceps tendons and in 11 \% of patellar tendons at its proximal
   insertion, while in the healthy marathon runner group, the Achilles
   tendon had this kind of lesion in 17 \% of the subjects. Neither the OA
   nor the healthy marathon runners had intra-tendinous tophi. The
   sensitivity and specificity of US to detect tophi or aggregates were
   69.6 and 92 \%, respectively, tendon involvement at the lower limbs in
   gout is very frequent, particularly in the patellar tendon, and US
   possesses good sensitivity and specificity for detecting intra-tendinous
   tophi.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To describe the quality of life among sepsis survivors.
   Design: Secondary analyses of two international, randomized clinical
   trials (A Controlled Comparison of Eritoran and placebo in patients with
   Severe Sepsis {[}derivation cohort] and PROWESS-SHOCK {[}validation
   cohort]).
   Setting: ICUs in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and
   Australia.
   Patients: Adults with severe sepsis. We analyzed only patients who were
   functional and living at home without help before sepsis hospitalization
   (n = 1,143 and 987 from A Controlled Comparison of Eritoran and placebo
   in patients with Severe Sepsis and PROWESS-SHOCK, respectively).
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: In A Controlled Comparison of Eritoran
   and placebo in patients with Severe Sepsis and PROWESS-SHOCK, the
   average age of patients living at home independently was 63 and 61
   years; 400 (34.9\%) and 298 (30.2\%) died by 6 months. In A Controlled
   Comparison of Eritoran and placebo in patients with Severe Sepsis, 580
   patients had a quality of life measured using EQ-5D at 6 months. Of
   these, 41.6\% could not live independently (22.7\% were home but
   required help, 5.1\% were in nursing home or rehabilitation facilities,
   and 5.3\% were in acute care hospitals). Poor quality of life at 6
   months, as evidenced by problems in mobility, usual activities, and
   self-care domains were reported in 37.4\%, 43.7\%, and 20.5\%,
   respectively, and the high incidence of poor quality of life was also
   seen in patients in PROWESS-SHOCK. Over 45\% of patients with mobility
   and self-care problems at 6 months in A Controlled Comparison of
   Eritoran and placebo in patients with Severe Sepsis died or reported
   persistent problems at 1 year.
   Conclusions: Among individuals enrolled in a clinical trial who lived
   independently prior to severe sepsis, one third had died and of those
   who survived, a further one third had not returned to independent living
   by 6 months. Both mortality and quality of life should be considered
   when designing new interventions and considering endpoints for sepsis
   trials.}},

Abstract = {{The critical regulation of the peripheral circadian gene implicated in
   osteoarthritis (OA) has been recently recognized; however, the causative
   role and clinical potential of the peripheral circadian rhythm
   attributable to such effects remain elusive. The purpose of this study
   was to elucidate the role of a circadian gene Bmal1 in human cartilage
   and pathophysiology of osteoarthritis. In our present study, the mRNA
   and protein levels of circadian rhythm genes, including nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide oxidase (NAD beta) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), in human
   knee articular cartilage were determined. In OA cartilage, the levels of
   both Bmal1 and NAD beta decreased significantly, which resulted in the
   inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity and Sirt1
   expression. Furthermore, the knockdown of Bmal1 was sufficient to
   decrease the level of NAD beta and aggravate OA-like gene expression
   changes under the stimulation of IL-1 beta. The overexpression of Bmal1
   relieved the alteration induced by IL-1 beta, which was consistent with
   the effect of the inhibition of Rev-Erb beta (known as NR1D1, nuclear
   receptor subfamily 1, group D). On the other hand, the trans-fection of
   Sirt1 small interfering RNA not only resulted in a reduction of the
   protein expression of Bmal1 and a moderate increase of period 2 (per2)
   and Rev-Erb alpha but also further exacerbated the survival of cells and
   the expression of cartilage matrix-degrading enzymes induced by IL-1
   beta. Overexpression of Sirt1 restored the metabolic imbalance of
   chondrocytes caused by IL-1 beta. These observations suggest that Bmal1
   is a key clock gene to involve in cartilage homeostasis mediated through
   sirt1 and that manipulating circadian rhythm gene expression implicates
   an innovative strategy to develop novel therapeutic agents against
   cartilage diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Research on the manifestations and health correlates of
   eating disorder symptoms among males is lacking. This study identified
   patterns of appearance concerns and eating disorder behaviors from
   adolescence through young adulthood and their health correlates.
   Method: Participants were 7,067 males from the prospective Growing Up
   Today Study. Surveys from 1999 to 2007 (spanning ages 13 26 years)
   provided repeated measures data on muscularity and leanness concerns,
   eating disorder behaviors (purging, overeating, binge eating, use of
   muscle-building products), and health correlates (obesity, non-marijuana
   drug use, binge drinking, and depressive symptoms).
   Results: Latent class analyses of observations at ages 13 to 15, 16 to
   18, 19 to 22, and 23 to 26 years identified 1 large Asymptomatic class
   and 4 symptomatic patterns: Body Image Disturbance (high appearance
   concerns, low eating disorder behaviors; 1.0\%-6.0\% per age period);
   Binge Eating/Purging (binge eating and purging, use of muscle-building
   products, low appearance concerns; 0.1\%-2.5\%); Mostly Asymptomatic
   (low levels of muscularity concern, product use, and overeating;
   3.5\%-5.0\%); and Muscularity Concerns (high muscularity concerns and
   use of products; 0.6\%-1.0\%). The Body Image Disturbance class was
   associated with high estimated prevalence of depressive symptoms. Males
   in the Binge Eating/Purging and Muscularity Concerns classes had high
   prevalence of binge drinking and drug use. Despite exhibiting modestly
   greater appearance concerns and eating disorder behaviors than the
   Asymptomatic class, being in the Mostly Asymptomatic class was
   prospectively associated with adverse health outcomes.
   Conclusion: Results underscore the importance of measuring concerns
   about leanness, muscularity, and use of muscle-building products when
   assessing eating disorder presentations among males in research and
   clinical settings.}},

Title = {{Decompression surgery for spinal metastases: a systematic review}},
Journal = {{Neurosurgical Focus}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to systematically review the
   literature on reported outcomes following decompression surgery for
   spinal metastases.
   METHODS The authors conducted MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science
   database searches for studies reporting clinical outcomes and
   complications associated with decompression surgery for metastatic
   spinal tumors. Both retrospective and prospective studies were included.
   After meeting inclusion criteria, articles were categorized based on the
   following reported outcomes: survival, ambulation, surgical technique,
   neurological function, primary tumor histology, and miscellaneous
   outcomes.
   RESULTS Of the 4148 articles retrieved from databases, 36 met inclusion
   criteria. Of those included, 8 were prospective studies and 28 were
   retrospective studies. The year of publication ranged from 1992 to 2015.
   Study size ranged from 21 to 711 patients. Three studies found that good
   preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS >= 80\%) was a
   significant predictor of survival. No study reported a significant
   effect of time-to-surgery following the onset of spinal cord compression
   symptoms on survival. Three studies reported improvement in neurological
   function following surgery. The most commonly cited complication was
   wound infection or dehiscence (22 studies). Eight studies reported that
   preoperative ambulatory or preoperative motor status was a significant
   predictor of postoperative ambulatory status. A wide variety of surgical
   techniques were reported: posterior decompression and stabilization,
   posterior decompression without stabilization, and posterior
   decompression with total or subtotal tumor resection. Although a wide
   range of functional scales were used to assess neurological outcomes,
   four studies used the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)
   Impairment Scale to assess neurological function. Four studies reported
   the effects of radiation therapy and local disease control for spinal
   metastases. Two studies reported that the type of treatment was not
   significantly associated with the rate of local control. The most
   commonly reported primary tumor types included lung cancer, prostate
   cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS This study reports a systematic review of the literature on
   decompression surgery for spinal metastases. The results of this study
   can help educate surgeons on the previously published predictors of
   outcomes following decompression surgery for metastatic spinal disease.
   However, the authors also identify significant gaps in the literature
   and the need for future studies investigating the optimal practice with
   regard to decompression surgery for spinal metastases.}},

Title = {{Did death certificates and a death review process agree on lung cancer
   cause of death in the National Lung Screening Trial?}},

Abstract = {{Background/aims: Randomized controlled trials frequently use death
   review committees to assign a cause of death rather than relying on
   cause of death information from death certificates. The National Lung
   Screening Trial, a randomized controlled trial of lung cancer screening
   with low-dose computed tomography versus chest X-ray for heavy and/or
   long-term smokers ages 55-74 years at enrollment, used a committee
   blinded to arm assignment for a subset of deaths to determine whether
   cause of death was due to lung cancer.
   Methods: Deaths were selected for review using a pre-determined
   computerized algorithm. The algorithm, which considered cancers
   diagnosed during the trial, causes and significant conditions listed on
   the death certificate, and the underlying cause of death derived from
   death certificate information by trained nosologists, selected deaths
   that were most likely to represent a death due to lung cancer (either
   directly or indirectly) and deaths that might have been erroneously
   assigned lung cancer as the cause of death. The algorithm also selected
   deaths that might be due to adverse events of diagnostic evaluation for
   lung cancer. Using the review cause of death as the gold standard and
   lung cancer cause of death as the outcome of interest (dichotomized as
   lung cancer versus not lung cancer), we calculated performance measures
   of the death certificate cause of death. We also recalculated the trial
   primary endpoint using the death certificate cause of death.
   Results: In all, 1642 deaths were reviewed and assigned a cause of death
   (42\% of the 3877 National Lung Screening Trial deaths). Sensitivity of
   death certificate cause of death was 91\%; specificity, 97\%; positive
   predictive value, 98\%; and negative predictive value, 89\%. About 40\%
   of the deaths reclassified to lung cancer cause of death had a death
   certificate cause of death of a neoplasm other than lung. Using the
   death certificate cause of death, the lung cancer mortality reduction
   was 18\% (95\% confidence interval: 4.2-25.0), as compared with the
   published finding of 20\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.7-26.7).
   Conclusion: Death review may not be necessary for primary-outcome
   analyses in lung cancer screening trials. If deemed necessary,
   researchers should strive to streamline the death review process as much
   as possible.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Image-guided tumor ablation is a technique whereby
   needle-like applicators are placed directly into solid tumors under
   guidance typically with computed tomography or ultrasound. Changes in
   IgG and IgM antibody glycosylation were studied during ablation-induced
   immune response to cancer, and the use of glycosylation as a biomarker
   for diagnosis, prognosis and disease treatment was examined.
   Methods: Plasma from 27 tumor patients was collected immediately before,
   after and for 6 months following ablation. IgG and IgM antibodies were
   isolated by use high-throughput chromatography, and analyzed by
   hydrophilic liquid chromatography. Thorough identification of glycan
   structures in each chromatography peak was performed by nano-liquid
   chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
   Results: Although antibody glycosylation was found to vary with cancer
   type, discernable patterns of change based on the successful treatment
   of tumors by ablation were not identified. One patient with renal clear
   cell carcinoma and poor disease outcome had unexpectedly high amount of
   oligomannose IgG glycans during the whole period of monitoring. In
   contrast, IgM antibodies did not follow the same pattern.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that glycosylation patterns are
   indicative of an immune system that is unable to prevent different types
   of cancer, rather than products of the immunostimulatory response to the
   ablation of tumor itself. Analyses of the outcome effect suggested that
   IgG glycosylation and IgM glycosylation are not associated with tumor
   ablation.
   General significance: Present work opens a new way for parallel
   determination of glycosylation changes of both IgG and IgM antibodies by
   use of high-throughput methods, and their future use as biomarkers for
   disease diagnosis and prognosis. This article is part of a Special Issue

Abstract = {{Localized deformation within energetic materials under impact loading
   may lead to the formation of hot spots, which can cause initiation or
   detonation of energetic materials. In this work, the thermal mechanical
   response of cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX) based granular
   explosives (GXs) and polymer-bonded explosives (PBXs) under impact
   loading has been investigated using finite element software ABAQUS. A
   series of three-dimensional mesoscale calculations is performed at
   impact velocities from 100 m/s to 500 m/s using a crystal plasticity
   constitutive model for HMX crystals that accounts for nonlinear,
   anisotropic thermoelasticity and for crystal plasticity. For PBX
   simulations, a viscoelasticity model is used for the polymer binder.
   Results show that the average and localized stress and temperature
   field, which are greatly affected by crystal anisotropy and polymer
   binder, of GXs are larger than those of PBXs. Qualitative agreement with
   Pop Plots from the experiments shows that GXs are more sensitive than
   PBXs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Binding of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to its
   receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) results in receptor
   activation and the subsequent release of matrix metalloproteinases
   (MMPs) that contribute to osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage degradation. As
   hypoxia is a defining feature of the chondrocyte microenvironment, the
   present study investigated the possible mechanism through which SDF-1
   induces cartilage degradation under hypoxic conditions. To do this, OA
   chondrocyte cultures and patient tissue explants pretreated with the
   CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100 were incubated with SDF-1. It was identified
   that hypoxic conditions significantly elevated the expression of CXCR4
   in osteoarthritic chondrocytes relative to normoxic conditions.
   Furthermore, SDF-1 elevated MMP-13 mRNA levels and proteinase activity.
   It also elevated the mRNA and protein levels of runt-related
   transcription factor 2, and induced the release of glycosaminoglycans
   and the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta. By contrast, such
   changes did not occur to an appreciable degree in cells that were
   pretreated with AMD3100. The results of the present study demonstrate
   that even under hypoxic conditions, where CXCR4 expression is
   significantly elevated in chondrocytes, AMD3100 effectively blocks this
   receptor and protects chondrocytes from OA-induced catabolism,
   suggesting that the successful inhibition of CXCR4 may be an effective
   approach for OA treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Even though it is recognized that vision plays an important role in
   grasping movements, it is not yet fully understood how the visual
   feedback of the hand contributes to the on-line control. Visual feedback
   could be used to shape the posture of the hand and fingers, to adjust
   the trajectory of the moving hand, or a combination of both. Here, we
   used a dynamic perturbation method that altered the position of the
   visual feedback relative to the actual position of the thumb and index
   finger to virtually increase or decrease the visually sensed grip
   aperture. Subjects grasped objects in a virtual 3D environment with
   haptic feedback and with visual feedback provided by small virtual
   spheres anchored to the their unseen fingertips. We found that the
   effects of the visually perturbed grip aperture arose preeminently late
   in the movement when the hand was in the object's proximity. The on-line
   visual feedback assisted both the scaling of the grip aperture to
   properly conform it to the object's dimension and the transport of the
   hand to correctly position the digits on the object's surface. However,
   the extent of these compensatory adjustments was contingent on the
   viewing geometry. The visual control of the actual grip aperture was
   mainly observed when the final grasp axis orientation was approximately
   perpendicular to the viewing direction. On the contrary, when the final
   grasp axis was aligned with the viewing direction, the visual control
   was predominantly concerned with the guidance of the digit toward the
   visible final contact point.}},

Abstract = {{Q and U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC) is a Fizeau
   interferometer sensitive to linear polarisation, to be deployed at the
   Antarctic station of Dome C. This experiment in its final configuration
   will be operated at 97, 150 and 220 GHz and is intended to target CMB
   primordial B-modes in a multipole window . A sensitivity of (95 \% CL)
   can be reached by the first module alone, after 2 years of operation.
   Here we review in particular its working principles, and we show how the
   QUBIC interferometric configuration can be considered equivalent to a
   pupil-plane filtered imaging system. In this context, we show how our
   instrument can be self-calibrated. Finally, we conclude by showing an
   overview of the first dual-band module (150/220 GHz), which will serve
   also as a demonstrator for the subsequent units, and review the
   technological choices we made for each subsystem, with particular
   emphasis on the detection system.}},

Abstract = {{This retrospective study was conducted to identify potential risk
   factors for Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) ventilator-
   associated pneumonia (VAP) and evaluate the association between Candida
   spp. airway colonization and A. baumannii VAP. Intensive care unit (ICU)
   patients who were on mechanical ventilation (MV) for >= 48 hours were
   divided into the following groups: patients with and without Candida
   spp. airway colonization; colonized patients receiving antifungal
   treatment or not; patients with A. baumannii VAP and those without VAP.
   Logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching were used to
   identify factors independently associated with A. baumannii VAP. Among
   618 eligible patients, 264 (43\%) had Candida spp. airway colonization
   and 114 (18\%) developed A. baumannii VAP. Along with MV for >= 7 days
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] 8.9, 95\% confidence intervals {[}95\% CI]
   4.9-15.8) and presence of a central venous catheter (aOR 3.2, 95\% CI

   identified as an independent risk factor for A. baumannii VAP. Patients
   with Candida spp. airway colonization were more likely to develop A.
   baumannii VAP than non-colonized patients (23\% vs. 15\%, P=.01 and 34\%
   vs. 15\%, P<.001 in propensity score-matched subgroups). Administration
   of antifungal agents was not associated with A. baumannii VAP (29\% vs.
   21\%, P=.153) but with higher in-hospital mortality (53\% vs. 39\%,
   P=.037). Candida spp. airway colonization (43\%) and A. baumannii VAP
   (18\%) were common in ICU patients who were on mechanical ventilation
   for at least 48 hours. Candida spp. airway colonization was an
   independent risk factor for subsequent A. baumannii VAP.}},
