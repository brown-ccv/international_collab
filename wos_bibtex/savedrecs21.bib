Title = {{Biological and Chemical Removal of Primary Cilia Affects Mechanical
   Activation of Chondrogenesis Markers in Chondroprogenitors and
   Hypertrophic Chondrocytes}},

Abstract = {{Chondroprogenitors and hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are the first
   and last stages of the chondrocyte differentiation process,
   respectively, are sensitive to mechanical signals. We hypothesize that
   the mechanical sensitivity of these cells depends on the cell surface
   primary cilia. To test this hypothesis, we removed the primary cilia by
   biological means with transfection with intraflagellar transport protein
   88 (IFT88) siRNA or by chemical means with chloral hydrate treatment.
   Transfection of IFT88 siRNA significantly reduced the percentage of
   ciliated cells in both chondroprogenitor ATDC5 cells as well as primary
   hypertrophic chondrocytes. Cyclic loading (1 Hz, 10\% matrix
   deformation) of ATDC5 cells in three-dimensional (3D) culture stimulates
   the mRNA levels of chondrogenesis marker Type II collagen (Col II),
   hypertrophic chondrocyte marker Type X collagen (Col X), and a molecular
   regulator of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy bone
   morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). The reduction of ciliated
   chondroprogenitors abolishes mechanical stimulation of Col II, Col X,
   and BMP-2. In contrast, cyclic loading stimulates Col X mRNA levels in
   hypertrophic chondrocytes, but not those of Col II and BMP-2. Both
   biological and chemical reduction of ciliated hypertrophic chondrocytes
   reduced but failed to abolish mechanical stimulation of Col X mRNA
   levels. Thus, primary cilia play a major role in mechanical stimulation
   of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy in chondroprogenitor cells
   and at least a partial role in hypertrophic chondrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the magnetic stability and endurance of MgO-based
   magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with an exchange-biased synthetic
   antiferromagnetic (SAF) pinned layer. When a uniaxially cycling
   switching field is applied along the easy axis of the free magnetic
   layer, the magnetoresistance varies only by 1.7\% logarithmically with
   the number of cycles, while no such change appears in the case of a
   rotating field. This observation is consistent with the effect of the
   formation and motion of domain walls in the free layer, which create
   significant stray fields within the pinned hard layer. Unlike in
   previous studies, the decay we observed only occurs during the first few
   starting cycles (< 20), at which point there is no further variance in
   all performance parameters up to 10(7) cycles. Exchange-biased SAF
   structure is ideally suited for solid-state magnetic sensors and
   magnetic memory devices. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined complex
   neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by impairments in social
   communication, by the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors,
   interests and activities, and by abnormalities in sensory reactivity.
   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising, emerging tool
   for the study and potential treatment of ASD. Recent studies suggest
   that TMS measures provide rapid and noninvasive pathophysiological ASD
   biomarkers. Furthermore, repetitive TMS (rTMS) may represent a novel
   treatment strategy for reducing some of the core and associated ASD
   symptoms. However, the available literature on the TMS use in ASD is
   preliminary, composed of studies with methodological limitations. Thus,
   off-label clinical rTMS use for therapeutic interventions in ASD without
   an investigational device exemption and outside of an IRB approved
   research trial is premature pending further, adequately powered and
   controlled trials. Leaders in this field have gathered annually for a
   two-day conference (prior to the 2014 and 2015 International Meeting for
   Autism Research, IMFAR) to share recent progress, promote collaboration
   across laboratories, and establish consensus on protocols. Here we
   review the literature in the use of TMS in ASD in the context of the
   unique challenges required for the study and exploration of treatment
   strategies in this population. We also suggest future directions for
   this field of investigations. While its true potential in ASD has yet to
   be delineated, TMS represents an innovative research tool and a novel,
   possibly transformative approach to the treatment of neurodevelopmental
   disorders. Autism Res2016, 9: 184-203. (c) 2015 International Society

Abstract = {{Objectives: One of the most prominent features of schizophrenia is
   relatively lower general cognitive ability (GCA). An emerging approach
   to understanding the roots of variation in GCA relies on network
   properties of the brain. In this multi-center study, we determined
   global characteristics of brain networks using graph theory and related
   these to GCA in healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia.
   Methods: Participants (N=116 controls, 80 patients with schizophrenia)
   were recruited from four sites. GCA was represented by the first
   principal component of a large battery of neurocognitive tests. Graph
   metrics were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging. Results: The
   global metrics of longer characteristic path length and reduced overall
   connectivity predicted lower GCA across groups, and group differences
   were noted for both variables. Measures of clustering, efficiency, and
   modularity did not differ across groups or predict GCA. Follow-up
   analyses investigated three topological types of connectivityconnections
   among high degree rich club nodes, feeder connections to these rich club
   nodes, and local connections not involving the rich club. Rich club and
   local connectivity predicted performance across groups. In a subsample
   (N=101 controls, 56 patients), a genetic measure reflecting mutation
   load, based on rare copy number deletions, was associated with longer
   characteristic path length. Conclusions: Results highlight the
   importance of characteristic path lengths and rich club connectivity for
   GCA and provide no evidence for group differences in the relationships
   between graph metrics and GCA.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a commonly occurring neurologic
   disorder that affects up to one third of women during pregnancy. RLS has
   been associated with increased sympathetic tone in the nonpregnant
   population. We examined whether a RLS surrogate is associated with a
   higher prevalence of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional survey of 1000 women
   interviewed soon after delivery by using an RLS surrogate question.
   Women were asked how frequently (0 = none, 1 -= rarely {[}<1 time/week],
   2 = sometimes {[}1-2 times/week], 3 = frequently {[}3-4 times/week], and
   4 = always {[}5-7 times/week]) they had ``experienced jumpy or jerky leg
   movements{''} in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Clinical charts were
   reviewed to obtain relevant demographic and clinical data, including the
   presence of gestational hypertensive disorders and neonatal outcomes at
   birth. Subjects who ``always{''} experienced RLS were compared with
   subjects experiencing symptoms less frequently or not at all with
   respect to prevalence of gestational hypertensive disorder.
   Findings: The mean ({[}SD]) age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and
   BMI at delivery were 29.0 (6.1) years, 26.1 (6.2) kg/m(2), and 32.0
   (6.3) kg/m(2), respectively. The overall prevalence of the RLS surrogate
   (jumpy or jerky leg movements) was 35.5\% with the following
   distribution on a Likert scale: score 1 = 6.4\%; score 2 = 10.2\%; score
   3 = 8.1\%; and score 4 = 10.8\%. Chronic hypertension was present in
   2.1\%, pregnancy-induced hypertension in 9.5\%, and preeclampsia in
   4.5\% of respondents. Subjects who reported ``always{''} having
   sensations of jumpy or jerky legs were more likely to have gestational
   hypertensive disorders compared with those who reported less frequent
   occurrence of the symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios were 3.74 (95\% CI,
   1.31-10.72; P = 0.014) for chronic hypertension; 1.26 (95\% CI,
   0.65-2.46; P = 0.487) for pregnancy-induced hypertension; and 2.15 (95\%
   CI, 0.97-4.75; P = 0.060) for preeclampsia. There was a significant
   association between leg movement score and neonatal birth weight
   (coefficient, -149.5 g {[}95\% CI, 276.9 to -22.5]; P = 0.005) and
   gestational age at birth (-0.7 week {[}95 \% CI, 1.1 to -0.2]; P =
   0.021) that persisted after adjusting for preeclampsia, diabetes, and
   smoking. (C) 2016 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic debris contaminates marine habitats globally, leading to
   several perceived ecological impacts. Here, we critically and
   systematically review the literature regarding impacts of debris from
   several scientific fields to understand the weight of evidence regarding
   the ecological impacts of marine debris. We quantified perceived and
   demonstrated impacts across several levels of biological organization
   that make up the ecosystem and found 366 perceived threats of debris
   across all levels. Two hundred and ninety-six of these perceived threats
   were tested, 83\% of which were demonstrated. The majority (82\%) of
   demonstrated impacts were due to plastic, relative to other materials
   (e.g., metals, glass) and largely (89\%) at suborganismal levels (e.g.,
   molecular, cellular, tissue). The remaining impacts, demonstrated at
   higher levels of organization (i.e., death to individual organisms,
   changes in assemblages), were largely due to plastic marine debris (>1
   mm; e.g., rope, straws, and fragments). Thus, we show evidence of
   ecological impacts from marine debris, but conclude that the quantity
   and quality of research requires improvement to allow the risk of
   ecological impacts of marine debris to be determined with precision.
   Still, our systematic review suggests that sufficient evidence exists
   for decision makers to begin to mitigate problematic plastic debris now,
   to avoid risk of irreversible harm.}},

Abstract = {{Human population growth and development have heavily degraded coastal
   ecosystems with cascading impacts across multiple trophic levels.
   Understanding both the direct and indirect trophic effects of human
   activities is important for coastal conservation. In New England,
   recreational overfishing has triggered a regional trophic cascade.
   Predator depletion releases the herbivorous purple marsh crab from
   consumer control and leads to overgrazing of marsh cordgrass and salt
   marsh die-off. The direct and indirect trophic effects of predator
   depletion on basal trophic levels, however, are not understood. Using
   observational and experimental data, we examined the hypotheses that (1)
   direct trophic effects of predator depletion decrease meiofaunal
   abundance by releasing deposit feeding fiddler crabs from consumer
   control, and/or (2) indirect trophic effects of predator depletion
   increase meiofaunal abundance by releasing blue carbon via the erosion
   of centuries of accreted marsh peat. Experimental deposit feeder removal
   led to 23\% higher meiofaunal density at die-off than at healthy sites,
   while reciprocally transplanting sediment from die-off and healthy sites
   revealed that carbon-rich die-off sediment increased meiofauna density
   by over 164\%: six times stronger than direct trophic effects.
   Recovering sites had both carbon-rich sediment and reduced deposit
   feeding leading to higher meiofauna densities than both die-off and
   healthy sites. This suggests that consequences of the trophic
   downgrading of coastal habitats can be driven by both direct and
   indirect trophic mechanisms that may vary in direction and magnitude,
   making their elucidation dependent on experimental manipulations.}},

Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Internet alcohol marketing is not well studied
   despite its prevalence and potential accessibility and attractiveness to
   youth. The objective was to examine longitudinal associations between
   self-reported engagement with Internet alcohol marketing and alcohol use
   transitions in youth.
   METHODS: A US sample of 2012 youths aged 15 to 20 was surveyed in 2011.
   An Internet alcohol marketing receptivity score was developed, based on
   number of positive responses to seeing alcohol advertising on the
   Internet, visiting alcohol brand Web sites, being an online alcohol
   brand fan, and cued recall of alcohol brand home page images. We
   assessed the association between baseline marketing receptivity and both
   ever drinking and binge drinking (>= 6 drinks per occasion) at 1-year
   follow-up with multiple logistic regression, controlling for baseline
   drinking status, Internet use, sociodemographics, personality
   characteristics, and peer or parent drinking.
   RESULTS: At baseline, ever-drinking and binge-drinking prevalence was
   55\% and 27\%, respectively. Many (59\%) reported seeing Internet
   alcohol advertising, but few reported going to an alcohol Web site (6\%)
   or being an online fan (3\%). Higher Internet use, sensation seeking,
   having family or peers who drank, and p ast alcohol use were associated
   with Internet alcohol marketing receptivity, and a score of 1 or 2 was
   independently associated with greater adjusted odds of initiating binge
   drinking (odds ratio 1.77; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13-2.78 and odds
   ratio 2.15; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-4.37 respectively) but not
   with initiation of ever drinking.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although high levels of engagement with Internet alcohol
   marketing were uncommon, most underage youths reported seeing it, and we
   found a prospective association between receptivity to this type of
   alcohol marketing and future problem drinking, making additional
   research and ongoing surveillance important.}},

Title = {{Stunting at 5 Years Among SGA Newborns}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of stunting at 5 years across etiological
   subgroups of small for gestational age (SGA) newborns.
   METHODS: We analyzed data of a subsample (N = 1100) of the Early
   Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. We defined SGA as birth
   weight <10th percentile, then classified subjects into etiological
   subgroups by each of 8 risk factors (ie, maternal prepregnancy
   underweight, short stature, smoking during pregnancy, alcohol use during
   pregnancy, inadequate gestational weight gain {[}GWG], hypertension,
   genital herpes infection, and multiple births) or by cooccurrence of 2
   often intertwined risk factors (smoking and inadequate GWG). We defined
   stunting as 5 years height-for-age z score below -2. We fitted logistic
   regression models to test whether the risk of stunting differed across
   SGA subgroups, adjusting for confounders.
   RESULTS: SGA subgroup with maternal short stature (odds ratio {[}OR] =
   3.88; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 2.16-6.96) or inadequate GWG (OR
   = 2.18; 95\% CI = 1.23-3.84) had higher risk of stunting at 5 years,
   compared with the SGA subgroup without the corresponding risk factor.
   SGA newborns with both maternal smoking and inadequate GWG during
   pregnancy had much higher risk of stunting at 5 years (OR = 3.10; 95\%
   CI = 1.21-7.91), compared with SGA newborns without any of these 2 SGA
   risk factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Etiological subgroups of SGA differed in risk of stunting
   at 5 years. SGA newborns of inadequate GWG mothers who smoke and SGA
   newborns of short mothers were at particularly high risk of stunting.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of wind-dispersed seeds around a parent tree depends on
   diaspore and tree traits, as well as wind conditions and surrounding
   vegetation. This study of a neotropical canopy tree, Platypodium
   elegans, explored the extent to which parental variation in diaspore and
   tree traits explained (1) rate of diaspore descent in still air, (2)
   distributions of diaspores dispersed from a 40-m tower in the forest,
   and (3) natural diaspore distributions around the parent tree. The
   geometric mean rate of descent in still air among 20 parents was highly
   correlated with geometric mean wing loading(1/2) (r=0.84). However,
   diaspore traits and rate of descent predicted less variation in
   dispersal distance from the tower, although descent rate(-1)
   consistently correlated with dispersal distance. Measured seed shadows,
   particularly their distribution edges, differed significantly among six
   parents (DBH range 62-181cm) and were best fit by six separate
   anisotropic dispersal kernels and surveyed fecundities. Measured rate of
   descent and tree traits, combined in a mechanistic seed dispersal model,
   did not significantly explain variation among parents in natural seed
   dispersal distances, perhaps due to the limited power to detect effects
   with only six trees. Seedling and sapling distributions were at a
   greater mean distance from the parents than seed distributions; saplings
   were heavily concentrated at far distances. Variation among parents in
   the distribution tails so critical for recruitment could not be
   explained by measured diaspore or tree traits with this sample size, and
   may be determined more by wind patterns and the timing of abscission in
   relation to wind conditions. Studies of wind dispersal need to devote
   greater field efforts at recording the rare dispersal events that
   contribute to far dispersal distances, following their consequences, and
   in understanding the mechanisms that generate them.}},

Abstract = {{Up to 30\% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit
   an inadequate response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). To date,
   genetic predictors of OCD treatment response have not been
   systematically investigated using genome-wide association study (GWAS).
   To identify specific genetic variations potentially influencing SRI
   response, we conducted a GWAS study in 804 OCD patients with information
   on SRI response. SRI response was classified as `response' (n = 514) or
   `non-response' (n = 290), based on self-report. We used the more
   powerful Quasi-Likelihood Score Test (the MQLS test) to conduct a
   genome-wide association test correcting for relatedness, and then used
   an adjusted logistic model to evaluate the effect size of the variants
   in probands. The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was rs17162912
   (P = 1.76 x 10(-8)), which is near the DISP1 gene on 1q41-q42, a
   microdeletion region implicated in neurological development. The other
   six SNPs showing suggestive evidence of association (P < 10(-5)) were
   rs9303380, rs12437601, rs16988159, rs7676822, rs1911877 and rs723815.
   Among them, two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium, rs7676822 and
   rs1911877, located near the PCDH10 gene, gave P-values of 2.86 x 10(-6)
   and 8.41 x 10(-6), respectively. The other 35 variations with signals of
   potential significance (P < 10(-4)) involve multiple genes expressed in
   the brain, including GRIN2B, PCDH10 and GPC6. Our enrichment analysis
   indicated suggestive roles of genes in the glutamatergic
   neurotransmission system (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.0097) and the
   serotonergic system (FDR = 0.0213). Although the results presented may
   provide new insights into genetic mechanisms underlying treatment
   response in OCD, studies with larger sample sizes and detailed
   information on drug dosage and treatment duration are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21)
   highlighted the importance of cities to climate action, as well as the
   unjust burdens borne by the world's most disadvantaged peoples in
   addressing climate impacts. Few studies have documented the barriers to
   redressing the drivers of social vulnerability as part of urban local
   climate change adaptation efforts, or evaluated how emerging adaptation
   plans impact marginalized groups. Here, we present a roadmap to reorient
   research on the social dimensions of urban climate adaptation around
   four issues of equity and justice: (1) broadening participation in
   adaptation planning; (2) expanding adaptation to rapidly growing cities
   and those with low financial or institutional capacity; (3) adopting a
   multilevel and multi-scalar approach to adaptation planning; and (4)
   integrating justice into infrastructure and urban design processes.
   Responding to these empirical and theoretical research needs is the
   first step towards identifying pathways to more transformative
   adaptation policies.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{As a natural biocomposite, Strombus gigas, commonly known as the giant
   pink queen conch shell, exhibits outstanding mechanical properties,
   especially a high fracture toughness. It is known that the basic
   building block of conch shell contains a high density of growth twins
   with average thickness of several nanometres, but their effects on the
   mechanical properties of the shell remain mysterious. Here we reveal a
   toughening mechanism governed by nanoscale twins in the conch shell. A
   combination of in situ fracture experiments inside a transmission
   electron microscope, large-scale atomistic simulations and finite
   element modelling show that the twin boundaries can effectively block
   crack propagation by inducing phase transformation and delocalization of
   deformation around the crack tip. This mechanism leads to an increase in
   fracture energy of the basic building block by one order of magnitude,
   and contributes significantly to that of the overall structure via
   structural hierarchy.}},

Title = {{Cognitive ability in childhood and the chronicity and suicidality of

Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{120-127}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background
   There is inconsistent evidence regarding the influence of general
   cognitive abilities on the long-term course of depression.
   Aims
   To investigate the association between general childhood cognitive
   abilities and adult depression outcomes.
   Method
   We conducted a cohort study using data from 633 participants in the New
   England Family Study with lifetime depression. Cognitive abilities at
   age 7 were measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
   Depression outcomes were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews
   administered up to four times in adulthood between ages 17 and 49.
   Results
   In analyses adjusting for demographic factors and parental psychiatric
   illness, low general cognitive ability (i.e. IQ<85 v. IQ>115) was
   associated with recurrent depressive episodes (odds ratio (OR)=2.19,
   95\% CI 1.20-4.00), longer episode duration (rate ratio 4.21, 95\% CI
   2.24-7.94), admission to hospital for depression (OR=3.65, 95\% CI
   1.34-9.93) and suicide ideation (OR=3.79, 95\% CI 1.79-8.02) and attempt
   (OR=4.94, 95\% CI 1.67-14.55).
   Conclusions
   Variation in cognitive abilities, predominantly within the normal range
   and established early in childhood, may confer long-term vulnerability
   for prolonged and severe depression. The mechanisms underlying this
   vulnerability need to be established to improve the prognosis of
   depression among individuals with lower cognitive abilities.}},

Abstract = {{The brain's default network (DN) has been a topic of considerable
   empirical interest. In fMRI research, DN activity is associated with
   spontaneous and self-generated cognition, such as mind-wandering,
   episodic memory retrieval, future thinking, mental simulation, theory of
   mind reasoning, and creative cognition. Despite large literatures on
   developmental and disease-related influences on the DN, surprisingly
   little is known about the factors that impact normal variation in DN
   functioning. Using structural equation modeling and graph theoretical
   analysis of resting-state fMRI data, we provide evidence that Openness
   to Experiencea normally distributed personality trait reflecting a
   tendency to engage in imaginative, creative, and abstract cognitive
   processes-underlies efficiency of information processing within the DN.
   Across two studies, Openness predicted the global efficiency of a
   functional network comprised of DN nodes and corresponding edges. In
   Study 2, Openness remained a robust predictor-even after controlling for
   intelligence, age, gender, and other personality variables-explaining
   18\% of the variance in DN functioning. These findings point to a
   biological basis of Openness to Experience, and suggest that normally
   distributed personality traits affect the intrinsic architecture of
   large-scale brain systems. (C) 2015 The Authors Human BrainMapping

Abstract = {{The catalytic activities of sulfur sites in amorphous MoSx for the
   electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated in
   aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   and linear sweep voltammetry, we found the turnover frequency for H-2
   production to increase linearly with the percentage of S atoms with
   higher electron binding energies. These S atoms could be apical S2-
   and/or bridging S-2(2-). To distinguish the catalytic performances of
   these two types of atoms, we turn to quantum chemical simulations using
   density functional theory. The apical S2- atoms were found to adsorb H
   weakly with a Gibbs free energy for atomic H adsorption (Delta G(H)) in
   excess of +1 eV, and were thus ruled out as reaction sites for HER. In
   situ Raman spectroscopy of the model {[}Mo3S13](2-) cluster further
   demonstrate the higher catalytic reactivity of the bridging S-2(2-) over
   terminal S-2(2-) (which have lower electron binding energy) for proton
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundReliable epidemiological data on sexual homicide are sparse,
   especially on trends in its incidence over time and age at arrest.
   AimsOur main aims were to study age at arrest and incidence trends for
   sexual homicide in the USA over about three decades (1976-2007).
   MethodsWe conducted longitudinal analyses of data from the largest USA
   homicide database available for the years 1976-2007.
   ResultsThe mean age at arrest for a sexual homicide was 26.3years (range
   7-76; modal 21years). Three quarters of these offenders were young
   adults aged 18-35. Age at probable first arrest for a sexual homicide
   rose significantly from a mean of 25 to a mean of 29years over the study
   period. The last decade of the three studied accounted for just one
   quarter of the homicides as charged in the whole period, but the
   proportion of sexual homicides specifically fell with each decade, so
   that the first period accounted for 56\% of those in the whole period,
   the second for 33\% and the final decade for just 11\%. This was
   reflected in a reduction in the proportion of all homicides that were
   sexual, from 1.4\% in the first decade to 0.8\% in the second and 0.4\%
   in the third, declining by a factor of five for adults and seven for
   juveniles.
   ConclusionsUse of official national criminal statistics has limitations
   in studying the epidemiology of any particular behaviour. Nonetheless,
   our findings of falling sexual homicide rates and of changes in at least
   one important demographic of these killers indicate a need for a
   considered reappraisal of such crimes. Establishment of accurate
   epidemiology and a study of associated factors may assist in the
   improvement of investigative and preventive strategies. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Scarce data are available regarding the dimensional structure of

   (DSM-5) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and how factors
   relate to external constructs. We evaluated six competing models of
   DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, including Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, and
   Hybrid models, using confirmatory factor analyses in a sample of 412
   trauma-exposed college students. We then examined whether PTSD symptom
   clusters were differentially related to measures of anger and
   impulsivity using Wald chi-square tests. The seven-factor Hybrid model
   was deemed optimal compared with the alternatives. All symptom clusters
   were associated with anger; the strongest association was between
   externalizing behaviors and anger (r = 0.54). All symptom clusters,
   except reexperiencing and avoidance, were associated with impulsivity,
   with the strongest association between externalizing behaviors and
   impulsivity (r = 0.49). A seven-factor Hybrid model provides superior
   fit to DSM-5 PTSD symptom data, with the externalizing behaviors factor
   being most strongly related to anger and impulsivity.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Changes in end-expiratory lung volume (a dagger EELV) in
   response to changes in PEEP (a dagger PEEP) have not been reported in
   mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. The purpose of this study
   was to determine the utility of measurements of a dagger EELV in
   determining optimal PEEP in ARDS patients.
   Methods Nine patients with ARDS were prospectively recruited. a dagger
   EELV was measured using magnetometers during serial decremental PEEP
   trials. Changes in PaO2 (a dagger PaO2) were simultaneously measured.
   Static respiratory system compliance (C-RS), a dagger PaO2/a dagger
   PEEP, and a dagger EELV/a dagger PEEP were calculated at each level of
   PEEP.
   Results For the group, a dagger EELV decreased by 1.09 +/- A 0.13 L
   (mean +/- A SD) as PEEP was reduced from 20 to 0 cm H2O with the
   greatest changes in a dagger EELV occurring over the mid range of the
   decremental PEEP curve. Optimal values for C-RS, a dagger EELV/a dagger
   PEEP, and a dagger PaO2/a dagger PEEP could be identified for each
   patient and occurred at PEEP levels ranging from 10 to 17.5 cm H2O.
   There was a significant correlation (r = 0.712, p = 0.047) between a
   dagger PaO2/a dagger PEEP and a dagger EELV/a dagger PEEP.
   Conclusions a dagger EELV can be measured from a decremental PEEP curve.
   Since a dagger EELV is highly correlated with a dagger PaO2, measures of
   a dagger PaO2/a dagger PEEP may provide a surrogate for measures of a
   dagger EELV/a dagger PEEP. Combining measures of a dagger EELV/a dagger
   PEEP with measures of C-RS may provide a novel means of determining
   optimal PEEP in patients with ARDS.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To examine whether tissue factor pathway inhibitor or acquired
   activated protein C (APC) resistance influences the increased risk of
   coronary heart disease (CHD) due to estrogen plus progestin therapy.
   Approach and Results Prospective nested case-control study of 205 cases
   of CHD and 481 matched controls in the Women's Health Initiative
   randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin therapy. After multivariable
   covariate adjustment, both baseline tissue factor pathway activity
   (P=0.01) and APC resistance (P=0.004) were associated positively with
   CHD risk. Baseline tissue factor pathway activity and APC resistance
   singly or jointly did not significantly modify the effect of estrogen
   plus progestin on CHD risk. Compared with placebo, estrogen plus
   progestin decreased tissue factor pathway inhibitor activity and
   increased APC resistance but these changes did not seem to modify or
   mediate the effect of estrogen plus progestin on CHD risk.
   Conclusions Tissue factor pathway inhibitor activity and APC resistance
   are related to CHD risk in women, but may not explain the increased CHD
   risk due to estrogen plus progestin therapy. The data from this study do
   not support the clinical use of measuring these hemostatic factors to
   help stratify risk before hormone therapy.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we use Israel/Palestine as a case study to examine the
   politics of human shielding, while focusing on the epistemic and
   political operations through which the deployment of the legal category
   of human shield legitimizes the use of lethal force. After offering a
   concise genealogy of human shields in international law, we examine the
   way Israel used the concept in the 2014 Gaza war by analyzing a series
   of infographics spread by the IDF on social media. Exposing the
   connection between the re-signification of space and the constitution of
   a civilian as a shield, we maintain that the infographics are part of a
   broader apparatus of discrimination deployed by Israel to frame its
   violence post hoc in order to claim that this violence was utilized in
   accordance with international law. We conclude by arguing that the
   relatively recent appearance of human shields highlights the
   manifestation of a contemporary political antinomy: human shields have
   to continue to be considered protected civilians, but since they are
   considered an integral part of the hostilities they are transformed into
   killable subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesion formation after digital flexor tendon injury greatly affects
   gliding function of the tendon, which is a major clinical complication
   after hand surgery. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has a
   critical role in adhesion formation during tendon healing. Persistent
   regulation of TGF-beta 1 through application of microRNA (miRNA)
   specifically inhibiting the function of TGF-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1-miRNA)
   holds promise for treatment of such a complication. Adeno-associated
   virus (AAV) was used to transfer TGF-beta 1miRNA to the chicken digital
   flexor tendons, which had been injured and surgically repaired. Four
   doses of AAV2-TGF-beta 1-miRNA (2 x 10(11), 2x10(10), 2x10(9) and 2 x
   10(8) vector genomes (vg)) were used to determine the transfection
   efficiency. At postoperative 3 weeks, we found a positive correlation
   between the administered AAV2-TGF-beta 1-miRNA doses and transfection
   efficiency. The transfection rate ranged from 10\% to 77\% as the doses
   increased. Production of TGF-beta 1 protein in the tendons decreased on
   increasing vector dosage. When 2 x 10(11) and 2 x 10(10) vg were
   injected into the tendon, gliding excursion of the repaired tendon and
   work of flexion of chicken toes were significantly increased and
   adhesion score decreased 6 and 8 weeks later, indicating the improvement
   of tendon gliding and decreases in adhesion formations. However, the
   ultimate strength of the tendons transfected at the dose of 2 x 10(10)
   vg was 12-24\% lower than that of the control tendons. The results of
   this study demonstrate that application of TGF-beta 1-miRNA had a mixed
   impact on tendon healing: adhesion around the tendon is reduced but
   strength of the tendon healing is adversely affected. Future studies
   should aim at maintaining the beneficial effects of reducing tendon
   adhesions, while eliminating the adverse effects of decreasing the
   healing strength.}},

Abstract = {{Aging is a major risk factor for progression of liver diseases to
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cellular senescence contributes to
   age-related tissue dysfunction, but the epigenetic basis underlying
   drug-induced senescence remains unclear. macroH2A1, a variant of histone
   H2A, is a marker of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci that
   synergizes with DNA methylation to silence tumor-suppressor genes in
   human fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated the relationship
   between macroH2A1 splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, and
   liver carcinogenesis. We found that protein levels of both macroH2A1
   isoforms were increased in the livers of very elderly rodents and
   humans, and were robust immunohistochemical markers of human cirrhosis
   and HCC. In response to the chemotherapeutic and DNA-demethylating agent
   5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), transgenic expression of macroH2A1
   isoforms in HCC cell lines prevented the emergence of a senescent-like
   phenotype and induced synergistic global DNA hypomethylation.
   Conversely, macroH2A1 depletion amplified the antiproliferative effects
   of 5-aza-dC in HCC cells, but failed to enhance senescence.
   Senescence-associated secretory phenotype and whole-transcriptome
   analyses implicated the p38 MAPK/IL8 pathway in mediating
   macroH2A1-dependent escape of HCC cells from chemotherapy-induced
   senescence. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
   revealed that this hepatic antisenescence state also required active
   transcription that could not be attributed to genomic occupancy of these
   histones. Collectively, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which
   drug-induced senescence is epigenetically regulated by macroH2A1 and DNA
   methylation and suggest macroH2A1 as a novel biomarker of hepatic
   senescence that could potentially predict prognosis and disease
   progression. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Students with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often do
   not actively engage in academic instruction because they have difficulty
   in attending to task demands in the classroom. Without adequate
   intervention, this may result in poor academic outcomes for these
   students. In a multiple baseline design study, we taught four 5th-grade
   students Samatha meditation and assessed active engagement in math
   instruction and the percentage of math problems correctly solved during
   baseline, meditation training, and meditation practice phases. Results
   showed the students had varying but low percentages of intervals of
   active engagement in math instruction during baseline, but evidenced
   statistically significant increases from baseline to the meditation
   practice phase. Similarly, their low but varying percentages of math

   significant increases from baseline to the meditation practice phase.
   These results suggest that Samatha meditation may enhance cognitive
   processes in students with ADHD at a level to benefit them academically.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A multiscale modeling approach is used to predict how the formability of
   dual-phase (DP) steels depend on the properties of their constituent
   phases and microstructure. First, the flow behavior of the steels is
   predicted using microstructure-based finite element simulations of their
   3D representative volume elements, wherein the two phases (ferrite and
   martensite) are discretely modeled using crystal plasticity constitutive
   models. These results are then used to calibrate homogenized
   constitutive models which are then used in large-scale finite element
   simulations to compute the forming limit diagrams (FLDs). The multiscale
   approach is validated by predicting the FLDs of two commercial DP steels
   and comparing the predictions with experimental measurements.
   Subsequently, the approach is used to compute flow behavior and FLDs of
   a series of `virtual' DP steels, constructed by varying the
   microstructural parameters in the commercial DP steels. The results of
   these computations suggest that combining the ferrite from one of the
   two commercial steels with the martensite of the other and optimizing
   the phase volume fractions can yield `virtual' steels with substantially
   improved properties. These include a material with an FLD0 (plane
   strain) that exceeds those of the commercial steels by 75\% without a
   degradation in strength; and a material with a flow strength (0.2\%
   offset) that exceeds those of the commercial steels by similar to 30\%
   without degradation of formability.}},

Title = {{Patient radiation exposure during transforaminal lumbar endoscopic spine
   surgery: a prospective study}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to describe patient radiation
   exposure during single-level transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy
   procedures at levels L2-5 and L5-S1.
   METHODS Radiation exposure was monitored in 151 consecutive patients
   undergoing single-level transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy
   procedures. Two groups were studied: patients undergoing procedures at
   the L4-5 level or above and those undergoing an L5-S1 procedure.
   RESULTS For the discectomy procedures at L4-5 and above, the average
   duration of fluoroscopy was 38.4 seconds and the mean calculated patient
   radiation exposure dose was 1.5 mSv. For the L5-S1 procedures, average
   fluoroscopy time was 54.6 seconds and the mean calculated radiation
   exposure dose was 2.1 mSv. The average patient radiation exposure dose
   among these cases represents a 3.5-fold decrease compared with the
   senior surgeon's first 100 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS Transforaminal lumbar endoscopic discectomy can be used as a
   minimally invasive technique for the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy
   in the setting of a herniated lumbar disc without the significant
   concern of exposing the patient to harmful doses of radiation. One
   caveat is that both the surgeon and the patient are likely to be exposed
   to higher doses of radiation during a surgeon's early experience in
   minimally invasive endoscopic spine surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed advantages of total disc replacement (TDR) over fusion in
   the lumbar spine are the preservation of motion and the avoidance of
   adjacent-level disease. One of the complications inherent in TDR is the
   possibility of vertebral body fracture due to trauma or a malpositioned
   implant. The resulting dilemma is that posterior decompression of the
   displaced bone fragment could then have a destabilizing effect and
   possibly require fusion, thus obviating the benefit of an arthroplasty
   procedure. In this study, the authors describe the technical

Abstract = {{Background Despite WHO recommendations to offer pregnant women treatment
   with praziquantel, many nations continue to withhold treatment, awaiting
   data from controlled trials addressing safety and efficacy. The
   objectives of this study were to assess whether treatment of pregnant
   women with schistosomiasis at 12-16 weeks gestation leads to improved
   maternal and newborn outcomes and to collect maternal and newborn safety
   data.
   Methods This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
   was done in 72 baranguays (villages) serviced by six municipal health
   centres in a schistosomiasis endemic region of northeastern Leyte,
   Philippines. Pregnant women (at 12-16 weeks gestation) who were
   otherwise healthy but infected with Schistosoma japonicum were enrolled
   and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either over-encapsulated
   praziquantel (total dose 60 mg/kg given as two split doses) or placebo.
   Participants, investigators, midwives, and laboratory staff were all
   masked to treatment. The primary outcome was birthweight. Safety data
   were collected including immediate reactogenicity, post-dosing
   toxicology ascertained 24 h after study drug administration, and
   maternal and newborn serious adverse events. Analysis followed the
   intention-to-treat principle. Analyses were done using hierarchical
   generalised linear models to adjust for identified confounders and
   account for potential dustering of observations within villages and
   municipalities. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
   NCT00486863.
   Findings Between Aug 13,2007, and Dec 3,2012,370 pregnant women were
   enrolled and randomly assigned to each treatment group (184 to the
   placebo group, 186 to the praziquantel group). Most women had
   low-intensity infections (n=334, 90\%). Treatment with praziquantel did
   not have a significant effect on birthweight (2.85 kg in both groups,
   beta=-0.002 {[}95\% CI-0.088 to 0.083]; p=0.962). Treatment was well
   tolerated with reactogenicity rates similar to those seen in
   non-pregnant participants (severe reactions occurred in five patients in
   the praziquantel group and two in the placebo group, and included
   headache, fever, and malaise). There were no significant differences in
   key safety outcomes including abortion, fetal death in utero, and
   congenital anomalies.
   Interpretation Results from this study provide important data from a
   controlled trial in support of the expansion of treatment policies to
   include pregnant women as recommended by WHO.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to chromium is increasing due to environmental pollution from
   industrial processes. Several epidemiological studies have investigated
   chromium exposure and reproductive outcomes, but few studies have
   investigated the association of chromium exposure and low birth weight
   (LBW). This study was designed to investigate whether maternal exposure
   to chromium during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of
   LBW. Chromium concentrations in maternal urine samples collected at
   delivery were measured in 204 LBW cases and 612 matched controls
   recruited between 2012 and 2014 in Hubei Province, China. Risk of LBW
   was associated with higher levels of chromium in maternal urine
   {[}adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.77 for the medium tertile, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 3.29; adjusted OR = 2.48 for the highest
   tertile, 95\% Cl: 1.33, 4.61; P trend = 0.01]. The association was more
   pronounced among female infants (adjusted OR = 3.67 for the highest
   tertile, 95\% CI: 1.50, 8.97) than among male infants (adjusted OR =
   1.22 for the highest tertile, 95\% CI = 0.48, 3.11) (p heterogeneity =
   0.06). Our findings suggest that maternal exposure to higher levels of
   chromium during pregnancy may potentially increase the risk of
   delivering LBW infants, particularly for female infants. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Cytokines are key molecules implicated in the
   defense against virus infection. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
   is well known to block the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV).
   However, the molecular mechanism and the downstream effector molecules
   remain largely unknown.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the antiviral effect and
   mechanism of p22-FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein) by ectopic expression
   in vitro and in vivo. In addition, to provide the biological relevance
   of our study, we examined that the p22-FLIP is involved in
   TNF-alpha-mediated suppression of HBV in primary human hepatocytes.
   Results: We found that p22-FLIP, a newly discovered c-FLIP cleavage
   product, inhibited HBV replication at the transcriptional level in both
   hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes, and that c-FLIP conversion
   to p22-FLIP was stimulated by the TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B pathway. p22-FLIP
   inhibited HBV replication through the upregulation of HNF3 beta but
   downregulation of HNF4 alpha, thus inhibiting both HBV enhancer
   elements. Finally, p22-FLIP potently inhibited HBV DNA replication in a
   mouse model of HBV replication.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that the
   anti-apoptotic p22-FLIP serves a novel function of inhibiting HBV
   transcription, and mediates the antiviral effect of TNF-a against HBV
   replication. (C) 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Abstract = {{Objective: We sought to identify characteristics associated with past
   malpractice lawsuits and how malpractice concerns may affect
   interpretive practices.
   Methods: We surveyed 207 of 301 (68.8\%) eligible dermatopathologists
   who interpret melanocytic skin lesions in 10 states. The survey assessed
   dermatopathologists' demographic and clinical practice characteristics,
   perceptions of how medical malpractice concerns could influence their
   interpretive practices, and past malpractice lawsuits.
   Results: Of dermatopathologists, 33\% reported past malpractice
   experiences. Factors associated with being sued included older age (57
   vs 48 years, P < .001), lack of board certification or fellowship
   training in dermatopathology (76.5\% vs 53.2\%, P = .001), and greater
   number of years interpreting melanocytic lesions (>20 years: 52.9\% vs
   20.1\%, P < .001). Of participants, 64\% reported being moderately or
   extremely confident in their melanocytic interpretations. Although most
   dermatopathologists believed that malpractice concerns increased their
   likelihood of ordering specialized pathology tests, obtaining recuts,
   and seeking a second opinion, none of these practices were associated
   with past malpractice. Most dermatopathologists reported concerns about
   potential harms to patients that may result from their assessments of
   melanocytic lesions.
   Limitations: Limitations of this study include lack of validation of and
   details about the malpractice suits experienced by participating
   dermatopathologists. In addition, the study assessed perceptions of
   practice rather than actual practices that might be associated with
   malpractice incidents.
   Conclusions: Most dermatopathologists reported apprehension about how
   malpractice affects their clinical practice and are concerned about
   patient safety irrespective of whether they had actually experienced a
   medical malpractice suit.}},

Abstract = {{We compute robust lower limits on the spin temperature, T-S, of the z =
   8.4 intergalactic medium (IGM), implied by the upper limits on the 21-cm
   power spectrum recently measured by PAPER-64. Unlike previous studies
   which used a single epoch of reionization (EoR) model, our approach
   samples a large parameter space of EoR models: the dominant uncertainty
   when estimating constraints on T-S. Allowing T-S to be a free parameter
   and marginalizing over EoR parameters in our Markov ChainMonte Carlo
   code 21CMMC, we infer TS >= 3 K (corresponding approximately to 1 sigma)
   for a mean IGM neutral fraction of x(HI) greater than or similar to 0.1.
   We further improve on these limits by folding-in additional EoR
   constraints based on: (i) the dark fraction in QSO spectra, which
   implies a strict upper limit of (x) over bar (HI) {[}z = 5.9] <= 0.06 +
   0.05 (1 sigma); and (ii) the electron scattering optical depth, tau(e) =
   0.066 +/- 0.016 (1 sigma) measured by the Planck satellite. By
   restricting the allowed EoR models, these additional observations
   tighten the approximate 1 sigma lower limits on the spin temperature to
   T-S >= 6 K. Thus, even such preliminary 21-cm observations begin to rule
   out extreme scenarios such as ` cold reionization `, implying at least
   some prior heating of the IGM. The analysis framework developed here can
   be applied to upcoming 21-cm observations, thereby providing unique
   insights into the sources which heated and subsequently reionized the
   very early Universe.}},

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{43-50}},

Abstract = {{Digital media use is widespread in University students, and use of
   digital media near bedtime has a broadly negative effect on sleep
   outcomes. Adequate and good quality sleep is important for physical and
   mental health, but few studies have rigorously measured both sleep and
   digital media use. In this study, we investigated whether self-reported
   sleep patterns were associated with digital media use in a first-year
   University student (N = 254, 48\% male) population. Students tracked
   their sleep through daily online diaries and provided digital media use
   data in 15-min blocks for 2 h prior to bedtime on nine occasions. A
   longer duration of digital media use was associated with reduced total
   sleep time and later bedtime, while greater diversity of digital media
   use was associated with increased total sleep time and earlier bedtime.
   Analysis of activities in the last hour before bedtime indicated that
   activity type plays a role in digital media's effect on sleep, with
   computer work, surfing the Internet, and listening to music showing the
   strongest relationship to multiple sleep variables. These findings have
   implications for physical and mental health of University students and
   can inform design of devices to minimize negative effects of digital
   media on sleep. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, we model the optical loss of short-circuit current
   density, J(SC), and conversion efficiency, eta, of thin film solar cells
   made of CdS/CdTe and CIGS/CdS chalcogenide materials having a graphene
   nanolayer electrode. The model is based on known materials optical
   constants e.g. refractive index and extinction coefficient reported in
   literature. Graphene has a superior transmission, conductivity and
   thermal stability than conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO)
   and metallic back contacts. We compare our modeling results with
   experimental data reported in the literature and re-optimize the
   thickness of device components. The interface reflections result in
   Delta J(SC) = -8.5\% whereas absorption in graphene, ZnO, CdS layers
   (with typical thicknesses) results in Delta J(SC) = -25\% for
   glass/grapheneanO/CdS/CdTe, and about 24\% for
   glass/MO/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/graphene solar cells. CIGS materials with higher
   bandgap (1.38 eV vs. 1.17 eV) cause a higher Delta J(SC). Graphene/ZnO
   contacted devices show lower efficiency loss with respect to graphene
   monolayer without ZnO layer. ZnO has a middle value of optical
   properties which balances the light refraction at the interface of
   graphene and chalcogenide materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Exposure to ion and micrometeoroid bombardment in the space environment
   causes physical and chemical changes in the surface of an airless
   planetary body. These changes, called space weathering, can strongly
   influence a surface's optical characteristics, and hence complicate
   interpretation of composition from reflectance spectroscopy. Prior work
   using data from the Dawn spacecraft (Pieters, C.M. et al. {[}2012].
   Nature 491, 79-82) found that accumulation of nanophase metallic iron
   (npFe(0)), which is a key space-weathering product on the Moon, does not
   appear to be important on Vesta, and instead regolith evolution is
   dominated by mixing with carbonaceous chondrite (CC) material delivered
   by impacts.
   In order to gain further insight into the nature of space weathering on
   Vesta, we constructed model reflectance spectra using Hapke's
   radiative-transfer theory and used them as an aid to understanding
   multispectral observations obtained by Dawn's Framing Cameras (FC). The
   model spectra, for a howardite mineral assemblage, include both the
   effects of npFe(0) and that of a mixed CC component. We found that a
   plot of the 438-nm/555-nm ratio vs. the 555-nm reflectance for the model
   spectra helps to separate the effects of lunar-style space weathering
   (LSSW) from those of CC-mixing. We then constructed ratio-reflectance
   pixel scatterplots using FC images for four areas of contrasting
   composition: a eucritic area at Vibidia crater, a diogenitic area near
   Antonia crater, olivine-bearing material within Bellicia crater, and a
   light mantle unit (referred to as an ``orange patch{''} in some previous
   studies, based on steep spectral slope in the visible) northeast of
   Oppia crater. In these four cases the observed spectral trends are those
   expected from CC-mixing, with no evidence for weathering dominated by
   production of npFe(0). In order to survey a wider range of surfaces, we
   also defined a spectral parameter that is a function of the change in
   438-nm/555-nm ratio and the 555-nm reflectance between fresh and mature
   surfaces, permitting the spectral change to be classified as LSSW-like
   or CC-mixing-like. When applied to 21 fresh and mature FC spectral
   pairs, it was found that none have changes consistent with LSSW.
   We discuss Vesta's lack of LSSW in relation to the possible agents of
   space weathering, the effects of physical and compositional differences
   among asteroid surfaces, and the possible role of magnetic shielding
   from the solar wind. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The echinocandin family of drugs is well characterized for antifungal
   function that inhibits beta-d-glucan synthesis. The aim of this work was
   to study whether micafungin, a member of the echinocandin family,
   elicits additional activities that prime the host's immune response. We
   found that in a Galleria mellonella model, prophylactic treatment with
   micafungin extended the life of Staphylococcus aureus-infected larvae (a
   pathogen to which the drug demonstrates no direct antimicrobial
   activity) compared to insects that did not receive micafungin (P <
   0.05). The inhibition of pathogens in the G. mellonella infection model
   was characterized by a 2.43-fold increase in hemocyte density, compared
   to larvae inoculated with PBS. In a murine model where animals were
   provided micafungin prophylaxis 3 days prior to macrophage collection,
   macrophages were found associated with an average 0.9 more fungal cells
   per macrophage as compared to saline-treated animals. Interestingly,
   micafungin-stimulated macrophages killed 11.6 +/- A 6.2 \% of fungal
   cells compared to 3.8 +/- A 2.4 \% of macrophages from saline-treated
   animals. The prophylactic provision of micafungin prior to Candida
   albicans infection was characterized by an increase in the
   proinflammatory cytokines CXCL13 and SPP1 by 11- and 6.9-fold,
   respectively. In conclusion, micafungin demonstrated the ability to
   stimulate phagocytic cells and promote an immune response that can
   inhibit microbial infections.}},
