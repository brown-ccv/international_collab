Title = {{Late presentation to HIV/AIDS care in Brazil among men who self-identify
   as heterosexual}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the factors associated with late presentation to
   HIV/AIDS services among heterosexual men.
   METHODS: Men infected by HIV who self-identified as heterosexual (n =
   543) were included in the study. Descriptive, biivariate and logistic
   regression analyses were performed to evaluate the factors associated
   with late presentation (defined as individuals whose first CD4 count was
   < 350 cells/mm(3)) in the study population.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of late presentation was 69.8\%. The
   multivariate logistic analysis showed testing initiated by the provider
   (OR adjusted 3.75; 95\% CI 2.45-5.63) increased the odds of late
   presentation. History of drug use (OR adjusted 0.59; 95\% CI 0.38-0.91),
   history of having sexually transmitted infections (OR adjusted 0.64;
   95\% CI 0.42-0.97), and having less education (OR adjusted 0.63; 95\% CI
   0.41-0.97) were associated with a decreased odds of LP.
   CONCLUSIONS: Provider initiated testing was the only variable to
   increase the odds of late presentation. Since the patients in this
   sample all self-identified as heterosexual, it appears that providers
   are not requesting they be tested for HIV until the patients are already
   presenting symptoms of AIDS. The high prevalence of late presentation
   provides additional evidence to shift towards routine testing and
   linkage to care, rather than risk-based strategies that may not
   effectively or efficiently engage individuals infected with HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Vietnam is concentrated in
   subgroups of the population, including men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a viable strategy for HIV prevention,
   but knowledge about and preferences for PrEP delivery among Vietnamese
   MSM are not well understood. Methods: In 2015, an online survey was
   conducted with recruitment via social networking websites for MSM and
   peer recruitment. A description of daily oral, long-acting injectable,
   and rectal microbicide formulations of PrEP was provided to
   participants. Participants were asked about their prior awareness of and
   interest in PrEP, and ranked their most preferred PrEP modality.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors
   associated with having heard of PrEP and preference for each PrEP
   modality. Results: Of 548 participants who answered demographic and
   PrEP-related questions, 26.8\% had previously heard of PrEP and most
   (65.7\%) endorsed rectal microbicides as their most preferred PrEP
   delivery modality. Commonly-cited perceived barriers to uptake of PrEP
   included concern about side-effects, perception about being HIV
   positive, and family or friends finding out about their sexual
   behaviour. In multivariable models, older participants less often
   endorsed rectal microbicides (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.95 per year,
   95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.99) and more often endorsed
   long-acting injectables (AOR 1.08 per year, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.14) as
   their preferred PrEP modality. Participants who were willing to pay more
   for PrEP less often endorsed rectal microbicides (AOR 0.81, 95\% CI
   0.72-0.92) and more often endorsed long-acting injectables (AOR 1.17,
   95\% CI 1.01-1.35) and daily oral pills (AOR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.00-1.35) as
   their preferred form of PrEP. Conclusions: A variety of PrEP modalities
   were acceptable to MSM in Vietnam, but low knowledge of PrEP may be a
   barrier to implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-based nanoparticles form the basis for a host of sustainable
   alternative technologies based on this earth-abundant, low-toxicity
   element that can adopt a variety of oxidation states, crystal phases,
   and functions. Control of size, shape, and phase stability is a
   challenge for many nano-iron-based technologies, especially those
   involving Fe-0 that is susceptible to oxidation under ambient
   conditions. This article presents a continuous method for hybridizing
   Fe-based nanoparticles with carbon in the form of graphene-encapsulated
   Fe-based particles with core-shell symmetry that allows flexible control
   of iron particle size, shape, and phase stability. The method uses FeOOH
   nanorods and graphene oxide as precursors, and subjects them to an
   aerosol-phase microdroplet drying and annealing process to yield a range
   of Fe/C nano-hybrids whose structure can be controlled through
   adjustment of aerosol process temperature and postsynthesis thermal
   treatment conditions. We demonstrate that FeOOH nanorods can be
   successfully encapsulated in graphene, and transform during annealing
   into encapsulated Fe3O4 or Fe-0 nanoparticles by reductive
   fragmentation, where the graphene nanosack acts as a carbothermic
   reductant. The hybrids are characterized by vibrating sample
   magnetometry and Cr(VI) removal rates in aqueous media. The Fe-0 -
   graphene hybrids show high activity, good stability, and good
   recyclability in aqueous Cr(VI) removal due to the effect of graphene
   encapsulation. The present work suggests this rapid and continuous
   synthesis method can produce stable Fe-based materials, and can be
   extended to other metal systems, where graphene encapsulation can induce
   in situ reduction of metal oxide precursors into zero-valent
   metal-graphene hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{Low frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) of a cortical seizure focus is
   emerging as an antiepileptic treatment. While conventional rTMS
   stimulators activate only superficial cortical areas, reaching deep
   epileptic foci, for example in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is possible
   using specially designed H-coils. We report the results of rTMS in a
   young adult with pharmacoresistant bilateral TLE who underwent three
   courses (of 10, 15, and 30 daily sessions) of unilateral rTMS over the
   hemisphere from which seizures originated most often. Seizure frequency
   was assessed before and after each block of rTMS sessions, as was the
   tolerability of the procedure. Seizure frequency declined significantly,
   by 50 to 70\% following each rTMS course. All sessions were
   well-tolerated. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to describe the clinical and
   epidemiological characteristics of patients hospitalized in Lithuania
   who are infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and to compare pandemic
   A(H1N1) pdm09 infection with postpandemic.
   In total, 146 subjects hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 were
   identified from 2009-2011. There were 53 during the initial pandemic
   wave in the summer of 2009, 69 during the peak pandemic period, and 24
   during the ``postpandemic{''} period that we included in this study.
   There were 22 subjects who died after laboratory confirmation of
   influenza A(H1N1) pdm09.
   No deaths were documented during the first wave. Subjects presenting
   during the peak of pandemic influenza had a greater incidence of fever
   (100\% vs 77.4\%; p<0.001), dry cough (95.7\% vs 82.7\%; p=0.01), and
   vomiting (26.1\% vs 1.9\%, p<0.001) as compared with patients infected
   during the first wave. The rate of bacterial pneumonia was 18.8\%
   (13/69) during the peak pandemic period and 12.5\% (3/24, p=0.754)
   during the postpandemic period. None of the postpandemic influenza
   subjects' intensive care unit stays were due to pneumonia.
   The hospitalized early 2009 H1N1 pandemic cases and postpandemic cases
   were milder compared with those at the peak of pandemic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous
   radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas.
   Materials and Methods: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were
   searched through August 2014 for all relevant studies on RFA for uterine
   leiomyomas. The efficacy and safety of RFA were assessed using the
   outcome measures of tumor volume, symptom severity score, health-related
   quality of life (HRQL) score, procedure-related complications, and
   reintervention. The authors calculated pooled event rates with 95\%
   confidence intervals using random-effects model to assess the effects of
   RFA. Results: Eight observational studies were identified as eligible
   for inclusion in this meta-analysis and included 370 patients. All
   analyzed outcomes showed statistically significant improvements from
   baseline to final follow-up. Twenty-seven complications were identified
   and five of them qualified as major complications. Five patients
   required reintervention after RFA. Conclusions: Percutaneous RFA is an
   effective and safe treatment for patients with uterine leiomyomas.}},

   (sigma(i)(f)) i(n)=1 where sigma(i) epsilon chi(') and chi(') is the
   dual space of chi. The space X-n is built with a greedy algorithm that
   is adapted to F in the sense that it is generated by elements of F
   itself. The algorithm also selects the linear functionals (sigma
   i)i(n)=1 from a dictionary Sigma subset of chi(') In this paper, we
   study the interpolation error max(f is an element of F)parallel to f-
   J(n) {[}f]parallel to chi by comparing it with the best possible
   performance on an n dimensional space, i.e., the Kolmogorov n-width of F

Abstract = {{Although booster phone calls have been used to enhance the impact of

   number of studies describing the content of these boosters. We conducted
   a qualitative analysis of booster calls occurring two weeks after an
   initial Web-based intervention for drug use and intimate partner
   violence (IPV) among women presenting for emergency care, with the
   objective of identifying the following: progress toward goals set during
   the initial emergency department visit, barriers to positive change, and
   additional resources and services needed in order to inform improvements
   in future booster sessions. The initial thematic framework was developed
   by summarizing codes by major themes and sub themes; the study team
   collaboratively decided on a final thematic framework. Eighteen
   participants completed the booster call. Most of them described a
   therapeutic purpose for their drug use. Altering the social milieu was
   the primary means of drug use change; this seemed to increase isolation
   of women already in abusive relationships. Women described IPV as
   interwoven with drug use. Participants identified challenges in
   attending substance use treatment service and domestic violence
   agencies. Women with substance use disorders and in abusive
   relationships face specific barriers to reducing drug use and to seeking
   help after a brief intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Kawauchi Village lies 20 km west of the Fukushima Daiichi
   nuclear power plant. On 16 March 2011, evacuation was ordered due to the
   threat of radiological exposure, and was lifted in April 2012. In this
   study, we aimed to evaluate the predisaster and postdisaster health
   status of the Kawauchi Villagers, measured by routine yearly physical
   examinations.
   Methods: We analysed the annual health examination data of residents of
   Kawauchi Village from 2008 to 2013, as available from the Japanese
   National Health Insurance system. Data from 2011 were not available due
   to the disaster. Since the health data included the same participants
   repeatedly from year to year, the sample was non-independent and
   generalised estimated equation modelling was used. A predisaster time
   period ( 2008-2010) was categorised for comparison with postdisaster
   2012 and 2013. The outcome examined was the prevalence of metabolic
   disease, and was adjusted for confounding factors.
   Results: Data for 20.6\%-25.9\% of the total residents were available in
   this period. In 2013, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome ( from 17.0\%
   to 25.2\%, p< 0.001), diabetes ( from 11.3\% to 17.0\%, p< 0.001),
   dyslipidaemia ( from 43.2\% to 56.7\%, p< 0.0001), hyperuricaemia ( from
   5.2\% to 8.4\%, p= 0.006) and chronic kidney disease ( from 16.1\% to
   26.7\%, p< 0.001) was found to be elevated significantly compared to
   predisaster years, while that of obesity or hypertension did not change.
   Conclusions: The present follow-up study for Kawauchi Village revealed
   an increase in lifestyle-related disease following the March 2011
   disaster and subsequent evacuation, and this trend still continues 2
   years later.}},

Journal = {{AUTOPHAGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1472-1486}},
Abstract = {{Macroautophagy/autophagy protects against cellular stress. Renal
   sublethal injury-triggered tubular epithelial cell cycle arrest at
   G(2)/M is associated with interstitial fibrosis. However, the role of
   autophagy in renal fibrosis is elusive. Here, we hypothesized that
   autophagy activity in tubular epithelial cells is pivotal for inhibition
   of cell cycle G(2)/M arrest and subsequent fibrogenic response. In both
   renal epithelial cells stimulated by angiotensin II (AGT II) and the
   murine kidney after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), we observed
   that occurrence of autophagy preceded increased production of COL1
   (collagen, type I). Pharmacological enhancement of autophagy by
   rapamycin suppressed COL1 accumulation and renal fibrosis. In contrast,
   genetic ablation of autophagy by proximal tubular epithelial
   cell-specific deletion of Atg5, with reduction of the LC3-II protein
   level and degradation of SQSTM1/p62, showed marked cell cycle arrest at
   the G(2)/M phase, robust COL1 deposition, and severe interstitial
   fibrosis in a UUO model, as compared with wild-type mice. In vitro, AGT
   II exposure triggered autophagy preferentially in the G(1)/S phase, and
   increased COL1 expression in the G(2)/M phase in renal epithelial cells.
   Stimulation of Atg5-deficient primary proximal tubular cells with AGT II
   also resulted in elevated G(2)/M arrest and COL1 production.
   Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy increased AGT
   II-mediated G(2)/M arrest. Enhanced expression of ATG5, but not the
   autophagy-deficient ATG5 mutant K130R, rescued the G(2)/M arrest,
   suggesting the regulation of cell cycle progression by ATG5 is autophagy
   dependent. In conclusion, Atg5-mediated autophagy in proximal epithelial
   cells is a critical host-defense mechanism that prevents renal fibrosis
   by blocking G(2)/M arrest.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to modulate the
   activity of dysfunctional brain circuits. The safety and efficacy of DBS
   in dementia is unknown.
   Objective: To assess DBS of memory circuits as a treatment for patients
   with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Methods: We evaluated active ``on{''} versus sham ``off{''} bilateral
   DBS directed at the fornix-a major fiber bundle in the brain's memory
   circuit-in a randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials. gov
   NCT01608061) in 42 patients with mild AD. We measured cognitive function
   and cerebral glucose metabolism up to 12 months post-implantation.
   Results: Surgery and electrical stimulation were safe and well
   tolerated. There were no significant differences in the primary
   cognitive outcomes (ADAS-Cog 13, CDR-SB) in the ``on{''} versus
   ``off{''} stimulation group at 12 months for the whole cohort. Patients
   receiving stimulation showed increased metabolism at 6 months but this
   was not significant at 12 months. On post-hoc analysis, there was a
   significant interaction between age and treatment outcome: in contrast
   to patients <65 years old (n = 12) whose results trended toward being
   worse with DBS ON versus OFF, in patients >= 65 (n = 30) DBS-f ON
   treatment was associated with a trend toward both benefit on clinical
   outcomes and a greater increase in cerebral glucose metabolism.
   Conclusion: DBS for AD was safe and associated with increased cerebral
   glucose metabolism. There were no differences in cognitive outcomes for
   participants as a whole, but participants aged >= 65 years may have
   derived benefit while there was possible worsening in patients below age
   65 years with stimulation.}},

   and pregnancy prevention among grade 8-10 boys and girls (aged 14-17

   implemented by teachers, nurses, and youth peer educators. Pre- and
   post-intervention surveys included 933 male and female students in two
   intervention and two comparison schools. The main outcome was condom use
   at last sex; secondary outcomes were partner communication, gender
   beliefs and values, perceived peer behaviors, and self-efficacy for
   safer sex. At 5 months post-intervention, change in condom use did not
   differ between intervention and comparison schools. Intervention school
   youth had greater increases in self-efficacy for unsafe sex refusal
   (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.61, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.01-2.57) and
   condom use (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.07-2.89), partner communication (OR 2.42,

Pages = {{707-714}},
Abstract = {{Background: The timing and consequences of alternations in substrate
   utilization in heart failure (HF) and their relationship with structural
   changes remain unclear. This study aimed to analyze metabolic changes
   associated with transition to overt heart failure in transgenic mouse
   model of HF resulting from cardiac-specific overexpression of
   constitutively active G alpha(q){*}.
   Methods: Structural changes quantified by morphometry, relative cardiac
   mRNA and protein expression of PPAR alpha, FAT/CD36, CPT-1, GLUT-4 and
   glycolytic efficiency following administration of 1-C-13 glucose were
   investigated in 4-14-month-old Tg alpha(q){*}44 mice (TG), compared with
   age-matched FVB wild type mice (WT).
   Results: Initial hypertrophy in TG (4-10-month of age) was featured by
   an accelerated glycolytic pathway that was not accompanied by structural
   changes in cardiomyocytes. In 10-month-old TG, cardiomyocyte elongation
   and hypertrophic remodeling and increased glycolytic flux was
   accompanied by relatively low expression of FAT/CD36, CPT-1 and PPAR
   alpha. During the transition phase (12-month-old TG), a pronounced
   increase in PPAR alpha with an increase in relative fatty acid (FA) flux
   was associated with anomalies of cardiomyocytes with accumulation of
   lipid droplets and glycogen as well as cell death. At the stage of overt
   heart failure (14-month-old TG), an accelerated glycolytic pathway with
   a decline in FA oxidation was accompanied by further structural changes.
   Conclusion: Tg alpha(q){*}44 mice display three distinct phases of
   metabolic/structural changes during hypertrophy and progression to HF,
   with relatively short period of increase in FA metabolism, highlighting
   a narrow metabolic changes associated with transition to overt heart
   failure in Tg alpha(q){*}44 mice that have therapeutic significance. (C)

   lengths, there exists a smooth algebraic curve in a toric variety whose
   analytification has skeleton G, and the corresponding tropicalization is

Abstract = {{HIV and AIDS have impacted on social relations in many ways, eroding
   personal networks, contributing to household poverty, and rupturing
   intimate relations. With the continuing transmission of HIV particularly
   in resource-poor settings, families and others must find new ways to
   care for those who are living with HIV, for those who are ill and need
   increased levels of personal and medical care, and for orphaned
   children. These needs occur concurrently with changes in family
   structure, as a direct result of HIV-related deaths but also due to
   industrialization, urbanization, and labor migration. In this special
   issue, the contributing authors draw on ethnographies from South Africa,
   Swaziland, Lesotho, Zambia, and - by way of contrast - China, to
   illustrate how people find new ways of constituting families, or of
   providing alternatives to families, in order to provide care and support

Abstract = {{Addressed herein is a facile protocol for the synthesis and assembly of
   FePd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to
   catalyze transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines under ambient
   conditions. 3.5 nm FePd NPs were synthesized by using a
   surfactant-assisted co-reduction method that allowed NP composition
   control. FePd NPs were then assembled on rGO via a liquid-phase
   self-assembly method and studied as catalysts to promote hydrogen
   transfer from ammonia borane (AB) to numerous nitroarenes in aqueous
   methanol solutions at room temperature. Among three different rGO-FePd,
   the commercial C-Pd and rGO-Pd catalysts tested, rGO-Fe48Pd52 showed the
   highest efficiency in converting nitroarenes to anilines, achieving
   >90\% yields within 10-20 min of reactions. Our work demonstrates an
   efficient and selective approach to transfer hydrogenation of

Abstract = {{Solid-state nanopores have been widely used in the past for
   single-particle analysis of nanoparticles, liposomes, exosomes and
   viruses. The shape of soft particles, particularly liposomes with a
   bilayer membrane, can greatly differ inside the nanopore compared to
   bulk solution as the electric field inside the nanopores can cause
   liposome electrodeformation. Such deformations can compromise size
   measurement and characterization of particles, but are often neglected
   in nanopore resistive pulse sensing. In this paper, we investigated the
   deformation of various liposomes inside nanopores. We observed a
   significant difference in resistive pulse characteristics between soft
   liposomes and rigid polystyrene nanoparticles especially at higher
   applied voltages. We used theoretical simulations to demonstrate that
   the difference can be explained by shape deformation of liposomes as
   they translocate through the nanopores. Comparing our results with the
   findings from electrodeformation experiments, we demonstrated that the
   rigidity of liposomes can be qualitatively compared using resistive
   pulse characteristics. This application of nanopores can provide new
   opportunities to study the mechanics at the nanoscale, to investigate
   properties of great value in fundamental biophysics and cellular
   mechanobiology, such as virus deformability and fusogenicity, and in
   applied sciences for designing novel drug/gene delivery systems.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{248-259}},
Abstract = {{Oil shale (OS) is an unconventional low-calorific-value fossil fuel, the
   usage of which is increasing due to increasing energy demand. Today,
   Estonia's OS usage is the largest in the world. Approximately 90\% of
   the electricity consumed is produced from Ca-rich OS. Most of the OS,
   approximately 12 million tons yearly, is used for power generation
   utilizing pulverized combustion (PC) and circulating fluidized bed
   combustion (CFBC) technologies that produce nearly 6 million tons of
   ash. As a result, Estonia has one of the world's highest CO2 emission
   rates per capita.
   The current study is focused on determination of the amount of CO2 bound
   by CFBC and PC boiler OS ashes in an ash field. The binding ability
   toward CO2 of the ash stored in an ash field is observed. Based on the
   in situ experimental data, when looking the binding abilities of ashes
   from both the technologies separately, it is found that approximately
   9.7\% of the CO2 emitted is bound by the CFBC ash and about 3.4\% by the
   PC boiler ash in an ash field.
   On the basis of experimental data it is found that approximately 5-6\%
   of the CO2 emitted is bound back by oil shale power plant ash fields and
   sediment ponds.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the impact of entry method and access diameter at
   fetoscopic surgery for twin twin transfusion syndrome in twin
   pregnancies with at least one survivor. The outcomes evaluated were
   prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) and birth <4 weeks, preterm birth
   (PTB) <28 weeks, and latency to birth. Methods: A retrospective analysis
   of prospectively collected data of consecutive laser procedures from 6
   centers was performed. Three entry methods (sheath + trocar; cannula +
   trocar; cannula + Seldinger) and 6 access diameters (2.3, 3.0, 3.3, 3.5,
   3.8, 4.0 mm) were used. Exclusion criteria were subsequent invasive
   interventions, termination of pregnancy or double fetal death after
   laser. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors for
   the study outcomes. Results: Six hundred seventy three fetoscopic laser
   cases were analyzed. The use of different entry methods and access
   diameters did not affect PROM or birth <4 weeks, or latency from laser
   to birth. Access diameter was associated with PTB <28 weeks. Cervical
   length was associated with PROM and birth <4 weeks, and latency from
   laser to birth. Conclusion: Instrument choice at fetoscopic laser
   procedures did not affect outcomes <4 weeks. Access diameter may affect
   the likelihood for PTB <28 weeks. Cervical length is critically
   associated with obstetrical outcomes following laser surgery. (C) 2016

Journal = {{HIV CLINICAL TRIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{173-180}},
Abstract = {{Background: Practical issues, including cost, hinder implementing
   virologic monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
   resource-limited settings. We evaluated factors that might guide
   monitoring frequency and efforts to prevent treatment failure after
   initial virologic suppression.
   Methods: Participants were the 911 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive
   adults with CD4 count <300 cells/mu L who started efavirenz-based ART in
   the international A5175/PEARLS trial and achieved HIV-1 RNA < 1000
   copies/mL at 24 weeks. Participant report of ART adherence was evaluated
   using a structured questionnaire in monthly interviews. Adherence and
   readily available clinical and laboratory measures were evaluated as
   predictors of late virologic failure (late VF: confirmed HIV-1 RNA >=
   1000 copies/mL after 24 weeks).
   Results: During median follow- up of 3.5 years, 82/911 participants
   (9\%) experienced late VF. Of 516 participants reporting missed doses
   during the first 24 weeks of ART, 55 (11\%) experienced late VF,
   compared with 27 (7\%) of 395 participants reporting no missed doses
   (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95\% CI: 1.08, 2.73). This difference persisted in
   multivariable analysis, in which lower pre-ART hemoglobin and absence of
   Grade >= 3 laboratory results prior to week 24 were also associated with
   higher risk of late VF.
   Discussion: In this clinical trial, the late VF rate after successful
   suppression was very low. If achievable in routine clinical practice,
   virologic monitoring involving infrequent (e.g. annual) measurements
   might be considered; the implications of this for development of
   resistance need evaluating. Patients reporting missed doses early after
   ART initiation, despite achieving initial suppression, might require
   more frequent measurement and/or strategies for promoting adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: This longitudinal study investigated person-environment
   interactions and adolescent substance use by examining whether, and if
   so how, early temperamental quality of sensation seeking interacted with
   current neighborhood characteristics to shape underage smoking,
   drinking, and marijuana use. Sample: Participants consisted of a
   community-representative sample of 352 adolescents. Methods: Early
   temperament was assessed when adolescents were between seven and 13years
   of age, and current neighborhood characteristics (as perceived by
   participants and their mothers) and current adolescent substance use
   (self-reported smoking, drinking, and marijuana use in the past 30 days)
   were assessed approximately three years later. Results: The results from
   a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression revealed a potent
   negative effect of the perceived neighborhood risk, such that riskier
   neighborhoods were associated with both a greater probability for any
   substance use among adolescents, and a greater frequency of substance
   use among those who were engaging in these behaviors. High sensation
   seeking was a risk factor only for frequency of substance use among
   adolescent extant users, but not for the likelihood of any use. In
   addition, a significant interaction between sensation seeking and
   neighborhood risk revealed that adolescent sensation seekers engaged in
   smoking, drinking, and marijuana use primarily under conditions of
   elevated neighborhood risk and increased opportunity for such behaviors.
   Conclusion: Underage substance use was affected by synergistic effects
   between personal and community risk factors.}},

   Depressive symptoms were more prevalent among MSM with lower income,
   lower educational attainment, and those in the unemployed/other
   employment category. Income, education, and employment made significant
   contributions in additive models after adjustment. The employment-income
   interaction was statistically significant, indicating a multiplicative

   (21 BSAFER, 19 control); 50\% were nonwhite and mean age was 30years.
   The most commonly used drugs were marijuana (88\%) and cocaine (30\%);
   45\% reported physical abuse, and 33\% reported severe combined physical
   and sexual abuse. Thirty-nine (98\%) completed the Web program, 30
   (75\%) completed the booster, and 29 (73\%) completed the 3-month
   follow-up. Mean System Usability Scale (SUS) for the BSAFER Web program
   was 84 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 78-89) of 100; mean Client
   Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) was 28 (95\% CI: 26-29) of 32. MI
   adherence scores were high and similar for both the Web program and the
   booster. Both intervention and control groups had small mean decreases
   in weekly drug use days (0.7 vs. 1.5 days); participants using drugs
   other than marijuana demonstrated greater average reductions in drug use
   than those using marijuana only. Conclusions: An ED Web-based
   intervention for SUDs and IPV in women demonstrated feasibility and
   acceptability. Future studies will examine efficacy of the BSAFER
   program and investigate whether specific subgroups of drug using women
   may be most responsive to ED-based Web interventions.}},

Abstract = {{South Africa currently sustains the largest antiretroviral treatment
   (ART) programme in the world. The number of people on ART is set to grow
   even more in the coming years as incidence remains stable, people on ART
   stay healthy, and guidelines for initiation become increasingly
   inclusive. The South African public health sector has increasingly
   relied on community- and home-based lay and professional carers to carry
   out the everyday tasks of rolling out the ART programme. Drawing on
   ethnographic research in one locality in the Western Cape, the paper
   explores the care practices of two such groups of carers implementing a
   Universal Test and Treat' (UTT) approach. The UTT approach being
   evlauated in this place is based on one model of the HIV treatment
   cascade, or care continuum, which focuses on the steps necessary to
   identify and link HIV-positive individuals to care and retain them in
   lifelong HIV treatment. In this context, community-based care workers
   are responsible for carrying out several discrete steps in the HIV care
   continuum, including testing people for HIV, linking HIV-positive
   individuals to care, and supporting adherence. In order to retain
   clients within the continuum, however, carers also perform other forms
   of labour that stretch their care work beyond more bounded notions of a
   stepwise progression of care. These broader forms of care, which can be
   material, emotional, social or physical in nature, appear alongside the
   more structured technical and biomedical tasks formally expected of
   carers. We argue that understanding the dynamics of these more
   distributed and relational forms of care is essential for the effective
   implementation of the care continuum, and of the UTT approach, in
   diverse contexts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores contextual heterogeneity within a community
   randomised trial HPTN 071 (Population Effects of Antiretroviral
   Treatment to Reduce HIV Transmission) carried out in 21 study
   communities (12 Zambian, 9 South African). The trial evaluates the
   impact of a combination HIV prevention package (including
   household-based HIV counselling and testing and anti-retroviral
   treatment (ART) eligibility regardless of CD4-count) on HIV incidence.
   The selection, matching and randomisation of study communities relied on
   key epidemiological and demographic variables and community and
   stakeholder support. In 2013, following the selection of study
   communities, a Broad Brush Survey (BBS) approach was used to rapidly
   gather qualitative data on each study community, prior to the
   implementation of the trial intervention. First-year process indicator
   intervention data (2014-2015) were collected during the household-based
   intervention by community lay workers. Using an open/closed typology of
   urban communities (indicating more or less heterogeneity), this
   qualitative inquiry presents key features of 12 Zambian communities
   using a list of four meta-indicators (physical features, social
   organisation, networks and community narratives). These indicators are
   then compared with four intervention process indicators in a smaller set
   of four study communities. The process indicators selected for this
   analysis indicate response to the intervention (uptake) amongst adults.
   The BBS qualitative data are used to interpret patterns of similarity
   and variability in the process indicators across four communities. We
   found that meta-indicators of local context helped to interpret patterns
   of similarity and variability emerging across and within the four
   communities. Features especially significant for influencing
   heterogeneity in process indicators include proportion of middle-class
   residents, proximity to neighbouring communities and town centre, the
   scale of the informal economy, livelihood-linked mobility, presence of
   HIV stakeholders over time and commitment to community action. Future
   interdisciplinary analysis is needed to explore if these patterns of
   difference continue to hold up over the full intervention period and all
   intervention communities.}},

Abstract = {{This practice update considers adolescent stalking. Adolescent stalking
   is an area of research that deserves further study, given findings from
   the adult stalking literature that suggest significant public health and

   adolescent dating violence or bullying, and directions to take for
   future research. A comprehensive review across five scientific databases
   yielded a total of nine peer-reviewed manuscripts incorporating varying
   sample sizes and adolescent populations. A synthesis of existing
   research suggests that adolescent stalking exists at levels at least as
   high as that documented among adults but appears to have some notable
   differences (e.g., behavioral patterns, risk factors) from stalking
   behaviors among adults. To date, there exists no published
   representative population-based study of adolescent stalking behaviors
   and its health and legal consequences. Future research is needed to
   determine accurate prevalence statistics and to differentiate
   characteristics and public health impact of adolescent stalking from

Abstract = {{A nearly complete dermal skull roof of a capitosaur stereospondyl with
   closed otic fenestrae from the middle Carnian Stuttgart Formation (Late
   Triassic) of Bielefeld-Sieker (NW Germany) is described. The specimen is
   assigned to the genus Cyclotosaurus based on the limited contribution of
   the frontal to the orbital margin via narrow lateral processes. A new
   species, Cyclotosaurus buechneri sp. nov., is erected based upon the
   following unique combination of characters: (1) the interorbital
   distance is short so that the orbitae are medially placed (shared with
   C. robustus); (2) the region lateral to the orbitae is only slightly
   broader than the orbitae (shared with C. posthumus, C. ebrachensis, C.
   intermedius, and C. mordax); (3) the postorbital region is slender
   (shared with C. ebrachensis); (4) the preorbital projection of the jugal
   is shorter than half the length of the snout (shared with C. mordax, C.
   ebrachensis, C. intermedius, C. posthumus, and C. hemprichi). A
   phylogenetic analysis of seven Cyclotosaurus species, including C.
   buechneri, and eight further capitosaur taxa with the Rhinesuchidae as
   an outgroup finds a monophyletic Cyclotosaurus. In accordance with its
   stratigraphic occurrence, C. buechneri nests at its base but is more
   derived than C. robustus. Among the more derived Cyclotosaurus species,
   C. ebrachensis and C. intermedius, as well as C. posthumus and C.
   hemprichi, form sister groups, respectively. However, the phylogenetic
   position of C. mordax with respect to both groups remains unresolved. In
   the phylogenetic analysis presented here, Cyclotosaurus is the sister
   group of the Heylerosaurinae (Eocyclotosaurus C Quasicyclotosaurus).
   Cyclotosaurus buechneri represents the only unequivocal evidence of
   Cyclotosaurus (and of a cyclotosaur in general) in northern Germany.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about why adolescents attempt suicide. The current study
   examined the endorsement, structure, and clinical correlates of
   adolescents' suicide attempt motivations as measured by the Inventory of
   Motivations for Suicide Attempts (IMSA). Suicidal adolescents (n=52) in
   a psychiatric unit were administered the IMSA and interviewed about
   their suicide attempts. Psychache, Hopelessness, and Escape were the
   most strongly endorsed motivations, and Interpersonal Influence the
   least endorsed. IMSA scales exhibited a 2-factor solution: 1) Internal
   and 2) Communication. Suicide intent was strongly correlated with
   Internal motivations and moderately inversely correlated with
   Communication motivations. Factor structure and mean endorsements were
   similar to adult samples. The IMSA is a useful measure to assess attempt
   motivations in adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{A cornerstone of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention is the
   identification, tracing, and notification of sex partners of index
   patients. Although partner notification reduces disease burden and
   prevents new infections as well as reinfections, studies show that only
   a limited number of partners are ever notified. Electronic communication
   technologies, namely, the Internet, text messaging, and phone calls
   (i.e., e-notification), have the potential to expand partner services.
   We conducted a systematic review of studies that have investigated the
   acceptability and utility of e-notification. We identified 23 studies
   that met the following criteria: (a) 9 studies presented data on the
   acceptability of technology-based communications for contacting sex
   partner(s), and (b) 14 studies reported on the utilization of
   communication technologies for partner notification. Studies found high
   levels of interest in and acceptability of e-notification; however,
   there was little evidence for actual use of e-notification. Taken
   together, results suggest that electronic communications could have
   their greatest impact in notifying less committed partners who would
   otherwise be uninformed of their STI exposure. In addition, all studies
   to date have been conducted in resource-rich countries, although the low
   cost of e-notification may have its greatest impact in
   resource-constrained settings. Research is needed to determine the best
   practices for exploiting the opportunities afforded by electronic
   communications for expanding STI partner services.}},

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Despite important advances in psychological and
   pharmacological treatments of persistent depressive disorders in the
   past decades, their responses remain typically slow and poor, and
   differential responses among different modalities of treatments or their
   combinations are not well understood. Cognitive-Behavioural Analysis
   System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only psychotherapy that has been
   specifically designed for chronic depression and has been examined in an
   increasing number of trials against medications, alone or in
   combination. When several treatment alternatives are available for a
   certain condition, network meta-analysis (NMA) provides a powerful tool
   to examine their relative efficacy by combining all direct and indirect
   comparisons. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis enables
   exploration of impacts of individual characteristics that lead to a
   differentiated approach matching treatments to specific subgroups of
   patients.
   Methods and analysis We will search for all randomised controlled trials
   that compared CBASP, pharmacotherapy or their combination, in the
   treatment of patients with persistent depressive disorder, in Cochrane
   CENTRAL, PUBMED, SCOPUS and PsycINFO, supplemented by personal contacts.
   Individual participant data will be sought from the principal
   investigators of all the identified trials. Our primary outcomes are
   depression severity as measured on a continuous observer-rated scale for
   depression, and dropouts for any reason as a proxy measure of overall
   treatment acceptability. We will conduct a one-step IPD-NMA to compare
   CBASP, medications and their combinations, and also carry out a
   meta-regression to identify their prognostic factors and effect
   moderators. The model will be fitted in OpenBUGS, using vague priors for
   all location parameters. For the heterogeneity we will use a half-normal
   prior on the SD.
   Ethics and dissemination This study requires no ethical approval. We
   will publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal. The study results
   will contribute to more finely differentiated therapeutics for patients
   suffering from this chronically disabling disorder.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{113-128}},
Abstract = {{Self-efficacy is central to health behaviour theories due to its robust
   predictive capabilities. In this paper, we present and review evidence
   for a self-efficacy-as-motivation argument in which standard
   self-efficacy questionnaires - i.e., ratings of whether participants
   `can do' the target behaviour - reflect motivation rather than perceived
   capability. The potential implication is that associations between
   self-efficacy ratings (particularly those that employ a `can do'
   operationalisation) and health-related behaviours simply indicate that
   people are likely to do what they are motivated to do. There is some
   empirical evidence for the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument, with
   three studies demonstrating causal effects of outcome expectancy on
   subsequent self-efficacy ratings. Three additional studies show that -
   consistent with the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument - controlling
   for motivation by adding the phrase `if you wanted to' to the end of
   self-efficacy items decreases associations between self-efficacy ratings
   and motivation. Likewise, a qualitative study using a thought-listing
   procedure demonstrates that self-efficacy ratings have motivational
   antecedents. The available evidence suggests that the
   self-efficacy-as-motivation argument is viable, although more research
   is needed. Meanwhile, we recommend that researchers look beyond
   self-efficacy to identify the many and diverse sources of motivation for
   health-related behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the lifetime prevalence and correlates of attempted
   suicide among transgender persons in Argentina. Data were derived from a
   nation-wide, cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. We assessed
   individual, social, and structural correlates of reporting a history of
   attempting suicide using logistic regression. Among 482 participants,
   the median age was 30, 91\% identified as transwomen, and 32\% resided
   in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. A lifetime suicide attempt was
   reported by 159 (33\%), among whom the median age at first attempt was
   17. In a multivariate model, internalized stigma was positively
   associated with a history of suicidal behavior, while participants with
   stable housing had reduced odds of prior suicide attempt(s). These
   findings suggest that reducing stigma and mitigating structural
   vulnerabilities (through, for example, the enactment and enforcement of
   laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity to ensure
   equitable access to housing) could be effective targets for intervention
   to reduce suicide attempts among transgender individuals in Argentina.}},

Title = {{Identifying micro-inversions using high-throughput sequencing reads}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background: The identification of inversions of DNA segments shorter
   than read length (e.g., 100 bp), defined as micro-inversions (MIs),
   remains challenging for next-generation sequencing reads. It is
   acknowledged that MIs are important genomic variation and may play roles
   in causing genetic disease. However, current alignment methods are
   generally insensitive to detect MIs. Here we develop a novel tool, MID
   (Micro-Inversion Detector), to identify MIs in human genomes using
   next-generation sequencing reads.
   Results: The algorithm of MID is designed based on a dynamic programming
   path-finding approach. What makes MID different from other variant
   detection tools is that MID can handle small MIs and multiple
   breakpoints within an unmapped read. Moreover, MID improves reliability
   in low coverage data by integrating multiple samples. Our evaluation
   demonstrated that MID outperforms Gustaf, which can currently detect
   inversions from 30 bp to 500 bp.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, MID is the first method that can
   efficiently and reliably identify MIs from unmapped short
   next-generation sequencing reads. MID is reliable on low coverage data,
   which is suitable for large-scale projects such as the 1000 Genomes
   Project (1KGP). MID identified previously unknown MIs from the 1KGP that
   overlap with genes and regulatory elements in the human genome. We also
   identified MIs in cancer cell lines from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
   (CCLE). Therefore our tool is expected to be useful to improve the study
   of MIs as a type of genetic variant in the human genome. The source code

Abstract = {{Agostic interactions are often used to activate inert C-H bonds, and
   thus facilitate new reactions. We report the first example of designed
   catalysts based on the agostic interaction. Novel copper(I) complexes
   {[}BBN(pz(x))(2)]Cu(PPh3)(n) (BBN = 9-borabicyclo{[}3.3.1]nonane; pz(x)
   = 3-substituted pyrazole; x = H, n = 2; x = Me, n = 1) and
   \{{[}BBN(pz(iPr))(2)]Cu\}(2) have been synthesized and characterized.
   Single crystal studies of the three compounds show weak intramolecular
   C-H center dot center dot center dot Cu interactions which can be
   assigned as agostic or anagostic interactions. Catalytic studies of
   these complexes toward carbenoid insertion into N-H bonds indicate these
   weak interactions act as a ``switch{''} which will be turned ``on{''} if
   interacting with the substrate and ``off{''} if eliminating the product
   and regenerating the weak interaction. The process of the ``switch{''}
   turning ``on{''} or ``off{''}, which is related to the catalytic effect,
   is found to be influenced by both steric effects and the solvent: a less
   sterically hindered catalyst in non-coordinating benzene results in high
   yield, while a more sterically hindered catalyst in coordinating THF
   results in relatively low yield.}},

Abstract = {{The association between alcohol intake and cutaneous squamous cell
   carcinoma (cSCC) is unclear. We studied the association between alcohol
   intake and incident invasive cSCC in three cohorts of women and men with
   repeated assessments of alcohol intake in the US. Information on alcohol
   intake was collected repeatedly during follow-up. Cumulative average of
   alcohol intakes was used. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models
   with time-dependent exposure were used to estimate relative risks (RRs)
   and 95\% confidence intervals, followed by a meta-analysis. During a
   follow-up of 4,234,416 person-years, 2,938 cSCC were identified. Alcohol
   intake was associated with an increased risk of cSCC with a
   dose-response relationship. Each additional drink (12.8 gram of alcohol)
   per day was associated with a 22\% increased risk of cSCC (RR 1.22, 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.13-1.31). White wine consumption of >= 5 times/wk
   was associated with an increased risk of cSCC (RR 1.31, 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.09-1.59). We found no increased risk of cSCC with other
   alcoholic beverages. The population-attributable risk associated with
   alcohol intake of >= 20 grams/d was 3\% of cSCCs. In conclusion, alcohol
   intake was associated with an elevated risk of cSCC. Among alcoholic
   beverages, white wine was associated with cSCC.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{6724-6733}},
Abstract = {{Background: The early diagnosis of glaucoma is a global problem.
   Physiologic large cup (PLC) with an abnormally high cup/disc ratio may
   be confused with changes of the optic disc in early glaucoma. However,
   fewer reports are available regarding PLC in normal population.
   Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) can provide quantitative topographic
   parameters of the optic discs and be used widely. Consequently, we
   desire to find the rule of morphologic changes of PLC in Chinese Han
   people using HRT for differentiating it from glaucoma. Methods: One
   hundred (100) subjects with PLCs and 74 subjects with normal cups (NCs)
   were examined by HRT. The topographic parameters were analyzed and the
   characteristics of the inferior, superior, nasal, and temporal quadrants
   of PLCs were examined. Parameters obtained from HRT were compared
   between two groups. The effect of age, refractive error, and disc area
   on each parameter was analyzed by the multiple linear regression model.
   This was a prospective study and the mean length of follow-up of the
   subjects was 28 months. Results: Compared to NC group, PLC group had
   larger disc (P < 0.0001) but smaller mean retinal nerve fiber layer
   thickness (mRNFLt) (P< 0.0001). The nasal quadrant of disc area was
   larger than the inferior quadrant. Mean cup depth and maximum cup depth
   were unaffected by refractive error (P = 0.0539, 0.2228, respectively),
   age (P = 0.1981, 0.8207, respectively) or disc area (P = 0.1927, 0.3718,
   respectively). There was no significant change in disc area or cup shape
   measure (P = 0.847, 0.051, respectively). Conclusions: Optic disc
   structural parameters in PLC presented a similar pattern to NC, while
   PLC's disc area was larger but mRNFL thickness was smaller than the
   NC's. There were some changes in the topographic parameters of the optic
   discs of PLC overtime, but no glaucomatous damage was detected during
   our follow up.}},

Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{Oscillations are fundamental to communication between neuronal
   ensembles. We previously reported that pain in awake rats enhances
   synchrony in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and attenuates coherence
   between S1 and ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamus. Here, we asked
   whether similar changes occur in anesthetized rats and whether pain
   modulates phase-amplitude coupling between VPL and S1. We also
   hypothesized that the suppression of burst firing in VPL using Z944, a
   novel T-type calcium channel blocker, restores S1 synchrony and
   thalamocortical connectivity. Local field potentials were recorded from
   S1 and VPL in anesthetized rats 7 days after sciatic chronic
   constriction injury (CCI). In rats with CCI, low-frequency (4-12 Hz)
   synchrony in S1 was enhanced, whereas VPL-S1 coherence and theta-gamma
   phase-amplitude coupling were attenuated. Moreover, Granger causality
   showed decreased informational flow from VPL to S1. Systemic or
   intrathalamic delivery of Z944 to rats with CCI normalized these
   changes. Systemic Z944 also reversed thermal hyperalgesia and
   conditioned place preference. These data suggest that pain-induced
   cortical synchrony and thalamocortical disconnectivity are directly
   related to burst firing in VPL.}},

Abstract = {{The alpha -> delta phase transition, which occurs favorably in planar
   films of a black alpha-HC(NH2)(2)PbI3 (alpha-FAPbI(3)) perovskite in the
   amibent, is retarded when alpha-FAPbI(3) is deposited upon mesoporous
   TiO2 scaffolds. It is hypothesized that this is due to the synergistic
   effect of the partial encapsulation of alpha-FAPbI(3) by the mesoporous
   TiO2 and the elevated activation energy for the transition reaction
   associated with the substantial increase of the TiO2/alpha-FAPbI(3)
   interfacial area in the mesoscopic system.}},

Abstract = {{Recent animal studies demonstrate that compulsive cocaine seeking
   strongly reduces prelimbic frontal cortex activity, while optogenetic
   stimulation of this brain area significantly inhibits compulsive cocaine
   seeking, providing a strong rationale for applying brain stimulation to
   reduce cocaine consumption. Thus, we employed repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to test if dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) stimulation might prevent cocaine use in humans. Thirty-two
   cocaine-addicted patients were randomly assigned to either the
   experimental group (rTMS) on the left DLPFC, or to a control group
   (pharmacological agents) during a 29-day study (Stage 1). This was
   followed by a 63-day follow-up (Stage 2), during which all participants
   were offered rTMS treatment. Amongst the patients who completed Stage 1,
   16 were in the rTMS group (100\%) and 13 in the control group (81\%). No
   significant adverse events were noted. During Stage 1, there were a
   significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug tests in the rTMS
   group compared to control (p=0.004). Craving for cocaine was also
   significantly lower in the rTMS group compared to the controls
   (p=0.038). Out of 13 patients who completed Stage 1 in the control
   group, 10 patients received rTMS treatment during Stage 2 and showed
   significant improvement with favorable outcomes becoming comparable to
   those of the rTMS group. The present preliminary findings support the
   safety of rTMS in cocaine-addicted patients, and suggest its potential
   therapeutic role for rTMS-driven PFC stimulation in reducing cocaine
   use, providing a strong rationale for developing larger
   placebo-controlled studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{PKC-theta is a negative regulator of TRAIL-induced and FADD-mediated
   apoptotic spectrin aggregation}},
Journal = {{FOLIA HISTOCHEMICA ET CYTOBIOLOGICA}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. During studies on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in
   lymphoid cells, we noted that aggregation of spectrin occurred early in
   apoptosis, i.e. before activation of initiator caspase(s) and prior to
   exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). We also found that protein kinase C
   theta (PKC-theta) co-localized with spectrin in these aggregates. Our
   previously published studies indicated that in formation of early
   apoptotic spectrin aggregates, either PKC-theta or other
   apoptosis-related proteins are involved. Taking into consideration above
   data, we decided to test the effect of PKC-theta and Fas-associated
   death domain protein (FADD) on spectrin aggregation in these cells
   during tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
   (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis.
   Material and methods. For PKC-theta gene (PRKCQ) or FADD gene expression
   silencing in Jurkat T cells we used lentiviral particles containing
   shRNA and scrambled shRNA, respectively. Spectrin aggregates were
   detected by Western blotting after Triton-X 100 extraction in pellet and
   soluble fractions or by confocal imaging.
   Results. TRAIL-induced apoptosis results in spectrin aggregation and
   leads to translocation and aggregation of PKC-theta. We found that
   phorbol-myristate acetate, a PKC activator and translocation inducer,
   has only a small effect on spectrin aggregation. To further confirm
   this, we have also shown that knock down of PRKCQ in Jurkat T cells
   accelerates the formation of TRAIL-induced spectrin aggregates.
   Transient overexpression of the beta-spectrin C-terminal fragment,
   containing multiple S/T phosphorylation sites, potential substrate sites
   for PKC-theta, accelerated the formation of spectrin aggregates.
   Silencing of downstream TRAIL receptor effector gene, FADD, delayed
   aggregation of spectrin, but did not reduce PKC-theta localization to
   the plasma membrane.
   Conclusions. In summary, our results show for the first time involvement
   of spectrin aggregation in TRAIL receptor-FADD apoptotic pathway and
   indicate that TRAIL-induced spectrin aggregate formation is mediated by
   FADD and negatively regulated by PKC-theta.}},
