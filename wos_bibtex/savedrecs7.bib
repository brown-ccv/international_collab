Title = {{IL-13R alpha 2 uses TMEM219 in chitinase 3-like-1-induced signalling and
   effector responses}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3l1) binds to
   and signals via IL-13R alpha 2. However, the mechanism that IL-13R alpha
   2 uses to mediate the effects of Chi3l1 has not been defined. Here, we
   demonstrate that the membrane protein, TMEM219, is a binding partner of
   IL-13R alpha 2 using yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation,
   co-localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays.
   Furthermore, fluorescence anisotropy nanodisc assays revealed a direct
   physical interaction between TMEM219 and IL-13R alpha 2-Chi3l1
   complexes. Null mutations or siRNA silencing of TMEM219 or IL-13R alpha
   2 similarly decreased Chi3l1-stimulated epithelial cell HB-EGF
   production and macrophage MAPK/Erk and PKB/Akt activation. Null
   mutations of TMEM219 or IL-13R alpha 2 also phenocopied one another as
   regards the ability of Chi3l1 to inhibit oxidant-induced apoptosis and
   lung injury, promote melanoma metastasis and stimulate TGF-beta 1.
   TMEM219 also contributed to the decoy function of IL-13R alpha 2. These
   studies demonstrate that TMEM219 plays a critical role in Chi3l1-induced
   IL-13R alpha 2 mediated signalling and tissue responses.}},

Abstract = {{The present status of clinical leg ulcer healing research was reviewed
   by 25 experts over 2 days on September 28 and 29, 2015. Multiple
   clinical effectiveness reviews were presented suggesting that published
   clinical wound healing research often does not meet present (2015)
   evidence based standards. Specific areas requiring remediation were
   highlighted and approaches to overcoming existing challenges were
   proposed. Participants using anonymous voting technology developed an
   action plan to resolve perceived deficiencies. Statements were accepted
   if 75\% of participants agreed. Older patients with a high frequency of
   comorbid conditions posed particular difficulties in designing clinical
   research protocols and better diagnostic categorization is necessary A
   standardized model template for collecting information about diagnosis
   and evaluation of the effect of interventions on healing of all types of
   leg ulcers was considered a high priority. Such a model template could
   be modified depending on the specific etiology of the leg ulcers.
   Generally agreed on quantifiable standards to establish degree of
   morbidity was considered a high priority. There was universal agreement
   that sources of funding and conflicts of interest needed to be disclosed
   in presentations and all publications. All clinical research studies
   should be registered with appropriate authorities. There was substantial
   enthusiasm for a clinical research network with quality standards for
   membership and an advisory research core available to investigators.
   Such a network should be funded and actively managed to insure long-term
   viability. The governance of such an entity needs to be established by
   the wound care community. The present trend to integrate patients into
   the clinical research process was endorsed and there was enthusiasm to
   develop patient advocacy for wound healing research.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of the Strength at Home Men's
   Program (SAH-M), a trauma-informed group intervention based on a social
   information processing model to end intimate partner violence (IPV) use
   in a sample of veterans/service members and their partners. To date, no
   randomized controlled trial has supported the efficacy of an IPV
   intervention in this population.
   Method: Participants included 135 male veterans/service members and 111
   female partners. Recruitment was conducted from February 2010 through
   August 2013, and participation occurred within 2 Department of Veterans
   Affairs hospitals. Male participants completed an initial assessment
   that included diagnostic interviews and measures of physical and
   psychological IPV using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales and were
   randomly assigned to an enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) condition or
   SAH-M. Those randomized to SAH-M were enrolled in this 12-week group
   immediately after baseline. Those randomized to ETAU received clinical
   referrals and resources for mental health treatment and IPV services.
   All male participants were reassessed 3 and 6 months after baseline.
   Female partners completed phone assessments at the same intervals that
   were focused both on IPV and on the provision of safety information and
   clinical referrals.
   Results: Primary analyses using hierarchical linear modeling indicated
   significant time-by-condition effects such that SAH-M participants
   compared with ETAU participants evidenced greater eductions in physical
   and psychological IPV use (beta = -0.135 {[}SE = 0.061], P =.029; beta =
   -0.304 {[}SE = 0.135], P =.026; respectively). Additional analyses of a
   measure that disaggregated forms of psychological IPV showed that SAH-M,
   relative to ETAU, reduced controlling behaviors involving isolation and
   monitoring of the partner (beta = -0.072 {[}SE = 0.027], P =.010).
   Conclusions: Results provide support for the efficacy of SAH-M in
   reducing and ending IPV in male veterans and service members. (C)

Title = {{Dynamic carbonate sedimentation on the Northern Line Islands Ridge,

Journal = {{MARINE GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{379}},
Pages = {{194-207}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The Line Islands Ridge (LIR), located south of the Hawaiian Islands
   between 7 degrees N and 1 degrees S, is one of the few large central
   Pacific regions shallower than the regional carbonate compensation
   depth. Thick sequences of carbonate sediments have accumulated around
   the LIR despite it being located in the sediment-starved central
   tropical Pacific. The LIR is an important source of carbonates to the
   surrounding region and deposition around the LIR has expanded the
   equatorial Pacific carbonate sediment tongue by about 5\% of its total
   area. Furthermore, sediments on the ridge are potentially important
   paleoceanographic archives. A recent survey at the crest of the LIR
   finds evidence for high current activity, significant erosion, but
   overall net sediment deposition. Currents are strong enough to form
   sediment waves and lee drifts in the Palmyra Basin, at the northern
   terminus of the LIR. Sediments along the LIR are pelagic foraminiferal
   sands that are easily eroded and flow out into the surrounding abyssal
   plain in active submarine channel systems. As channels migrate, pelagic
   sediments fill in the abandoned channel arms. Despite significant
   sediment losses from the top of the ridge, 1.3 km of sediment has
   accumulated in the upper Palmyra Basin over basement formed 68 to 85
   million years ago (Ma). Late Neogene erosion may be more extensive than
   earlier erosion cycles, in response to reduced sediment production as
   the Palmyra Basin exited the high productivity equatorial latitudes.
   Sediments with good stratigraphic order needed for paleoceanographic
   study are limited in this dynamic sedimentary environment, but can be
   found with proper survey. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The role of genetics and antibodies in sepsis}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{During the course of sepsis when immunosuppression predominates, the
   concentrations of circulating immunoglobulins (IGs) are decreased and
   this is associated with adverse outcomes. The production of IGs as
   response to invasive bacterial pathogens takes place through a complex
   pathway starting from the recognition of the antigen (Ag) by innate
   immune cells that process and present Ags to T cells. The orchestration
   of T-helper (Th) lymphocyte responses directs specific B cells and ends
   with the production of IGs by plasma cells. All molecules implicated in
   this process are encoded by genes bearing single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs). Meta-analysis of case-control studies have shown
   that the carriage of minor frequency SNPs of CD14, TLR2 and TNF is
   associated with increased sepsis risk. The ambiguity of results of
   clinical trials studying the clinical efficacy of exogenous IG
   administration in sepsis suggests that efficacy of treatment should be
   considered after adjustment for SNPs of all implicated genes in the
   pathway of IG production.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3681-3689}},

Abstract = {{Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is long-term performance improvement as
   a result of perceptual experience. It is unclear whether VPL is
   associated with refinement in representations of the trained feature
   (feature-based plasticity), improvement in processing of the trained
   task (task-based plasticity), or both. Here, we provide empirical
   evidence that VPL of motion detection is associated with both types of
   plasticity which occur predominantly in different brain areas. Before
   and after training on a motion detection task, subjects' neural
   responses to the trained motion stimuli were measured using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. In V3A, significant response changes after
   training were observed specifically to the trained motion stimulus but
   independently of whether subjects performed the trained task. This
   suggests that the response changes in V3A represent feature-based
   plasticity in VPL of motion detection. In V1 and the intraparietal
   sulcus, significant response changes were found only when subjects
   performed the trained task on the trained motion stimulus. This suggests
   that the response changes in these areas reflect task-based plasticity.
   These results collectively suggest that VPL of motion detection is
   associated with the 2 types of plasticity, which occur in different
   areas and therefore have separate mechanisms at least to some degree.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated cultural differences between U.S. and Japanese color
   preferences and the ecological factors that might influence them.
   Japanese and U.S. color preferences have both similarities (e.g., peaks
   around blue, troughs around dark-yellow, and preferences for saturated
   colors) and differences (Japanese participants like darker colors less
   than U.S. participants do). Complex gender differences were also evident
   that did not conform to previously reported effects. Palmer and
   Schloss's (2010) weighted affective valence estimate (WAVE) procedure
   was used to test the Ecological Valence Theory's (EVT's) prediction that
   within-culture WAVE-preference correlations should be higher than
   between-culture WAVE-preference correlations. The results supported
   several, but not all, predictions. In the second experiment, we tested
   color preferences of Japanese-U.S. multicultural participants who could
   read and speak both Japanese and English. Multicultural color
   preferences were intermediate between U.S. and Japanese preferences,
   consistent with the hypothesis that culturally specific personal
   experiences during one's lifetime influence color preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual behavior is the dominant mode of HIV transmission in China, and
   young female migrants are among the populations at highest risk. This
   article examines how HIV-related risk behaviors among female migrants
   might vary according to workplace settings. Participants were young
   female migrants recruited from three workplace settings-factories,
   restaurants and entertainment venues. In a cross-sectional survey, we
   assessed 457 participants' sociodemographic characteristics,
   HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, condom use knowledge, sexual behaviors,
   condom use behavior and reproductive health factors. Participants
   working in entertainment venues were significantly more likely than
   those working in factories and restaurants to report sexual behavior,
   unprotected sex, multiple pregnancy terminations and sexually
   transmitted infections (STI). However, participants working in factories
   and restaurants reported significantly lower levels of HIV/AIDS
   knowledge, condom use knowledge, condom use self-efficacy and history of
   HIV/AIDS counseling and testing. Independent correlates of unprotected
   sex included employment in an entertainment venue, abortion history and
   sexual self-efficacy. Independent correlates of STI or genitourinary
   tract infection included employment in an entertainment venue, abortion
   history, recent migration and recent unprotected sex. These findings
   indicate a need for sexual and reproductive health interventions
   prioritizing young female migrants, and call for programs that can be
   incorporated into different workplace settings.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Interassay harmonization of cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA
   measurement is important for infection management. Uncertainty exists
   regarding the result harmonization achievable in patient plasma samples
   using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays with
   calibrators now traceable to the First World Health Organization
   International Standard (IS) for CMV DNA.
   Method. Serial dilutions of the IS and a blinded panel of 40 genotyped
   CMV DNA-positive pooled plasma samples and 10 negative plasma samples
   were tested by 6 laboratories using 10 qPCR assays calibrated to the IS.
   Each clinical sample was constructed using plasma from a single unique
   transplant recipient.
   Results. The variance for individual CMV DNA-positive samples was
   greater for clinical samples (median, 1.50 {[}range, 1.22-2.82] log(10)
   IU/mL) than for IS dilutions (median, 0.94 {[}range, 0.69-1.35] log(10)
   IU/mL) (P < .001); 58.9\% of all clinical sample results and 93.6\% of
   IS dilution results fell within +/- 0.5 log(10) IU/mL of the mean viral
   load of each sample. Result variability was not impacted by either
   genotype or quantitative levels of CMV DNA. Testing procedure
   differences can significantly influence results, even when
   analyte-specific reagents are identical. For clinical samples, all
   assays demonstrated result bias (P < .008). Assays with amplicon sizes
   <= 86 bp had significantly higher results compared to assays with larger
   amplicon sizes (>= 105 bp) (P < .001).
   Conclusions. The variability in CMV DNA results reported on individual
   samples has been reduced by the IS, but ongoing clinically relevant
   variability persists, preventing meaningful interassay result
   comparison.}},

Journal = {{CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{171}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The consequences of hydrous basaltic melts and peridotite interaction
   were examined experimentally in Au-Pd, Pt, and graphite capsules using
   the reaction couple method. Reactions between a hydrous basaltic
   andesite (4 wt\% H2O) and dunite or lherzolite in an Au-Pd capsule at 1
   GPa and 1200 degrees C produce a melt-bearing orthopyroxenite-dunite
   sequence. Reactions between a hydrous ferrobasalt and lherzolite in Pt
   or Au-Pd capsules at 0.8-2 GPa and 1250-1385 degrees C produce a
   melt-bearing orthopyroxenite-harzburgite sequence. Reactions between the
   ferrobasalt and lherzolite in graphite capsules (not designed to retain
   water) result in a melt-bearing dunite-harzburgite sequence at 1 GPa and
   a melt-bearing harzburgite-lherzolite sequence at 2 GPa. The
   orthopyroxenite from the hydrous reaction experiments has a high
   porosity, and it is separated by a sharp lithological interface from the
   dunite or harzburgite. Orthopyroxenes in the orthopyroxenite are large
   in size with resorbed olivine inclusions. Formation of the high-porosity
   orthopyroxenite in the hydrous melt-rock reaction experiments is
   determined by the liquidus phase relation of the interface reacting melt
   and reaction kinetics. Reaction between orthopyroxene-saturated hydrous
   melt and olivine at melt-rock interface produces orthopyroxenite. Water
   infiltration induces hydrous melting of the lherzolite, producing a
   dunite or an orthopyroxene-depleted harzburgite. Efficient diffusive
   exchange between the partial melt and the hydrous reacting melt promotes
   orthopyroxene-oversaturation around the melt-rock interfacial region.
   The simplified experiments reveal end-member processes for understanding
   the formation of orthopyroxenite in the upper mantle. The presence of
   orthopyroxenites in mantle samples is a strong indication of hydrous
   melt and peridotite interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Compare the effectiveness of different cutaneous antiseptics in reducing
   risk of catheter-related infection in intensive care unit (ICU)
   patients.
   We compared the risk of central venous catheter-related infection
   according to four-step (scrub, rinse, dry, and disinfect) alcoholic 5 \%
   povidone-iodine (PVI-a, n = 1521), one-step (disinfect) alcoholic 2 \%
   chlorhexidine (2 \% CHX-a, n = 1116), four-step alcoholic < 1 \%
   chlorhexidine (< 1 \% CHX-a, n = 357), and four-step aqueous 10 \%
   povidone-iodine (PVI, n = 368) antiseptics used for cutaneous
   disinfection and catheter care during the 3SITES multicenter randomized
   controlled trial. Within this cohort, we performed a quasi-experimental
   study (i.e., before-after) involving the four ICUs which switched from
   PVI-a to 2 \% CHX-a. We used propensity score matching (PSM, n = 776)
   and inverse probability weighting treatment (IPWT, n = 1592). The end
   point was the incidence of catheter-related infection (CRI) defined as
   catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or a positive catheter
   tip culture plus clinical sepsis on catheter removal.
   In the cohort analysis and compared with PVI-a, the incidence of CRI was
   lower with 2 \% CHX-a {[}adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.51; 95 \%
   confidence interval (CI) (0.28-0.96), p = 0.037] and similar with < 1 \%
   CHX-a {[}aHR, 0.73; (0.36-1.48), p = 0.37] and PVI {[}aHR, 1.50; 95 \%
   CI (0.85-2.64), p = 0.16] after controlling for potential confounders.
   In the quasi-experimental study and compared with PVI-a, the incidence
   of catheter-related infection was again lower with 2 \% CHX-a after PSM
   {[}HR, 0.35; 95 \% CI (0.15, 0.84), p = 0.02] and in the IPWT analysis
   {[}HR, 0.31; 95 \% CI (0.14, 0.70), p = 0.005]. The incidence of CRBSI
   or adverse event was not significantly different between antiseptics in
   all analyses.
   In comparison with PVI-a, the use of 2 \% CHX-a for cutaneous
   disinfection of the central venous catheter insertion site and
   maintenance catheter care was associated with a reduced risk of catheter
   infection, while the benefit of < 1 \% CHX-a was uncertain.

Abstract = {{Objectives: Multiple lines of evidence from genetic linkage studies to
   animal models implicate aberrant cortical plasticity and metaplasticity
   in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and fragile X
   syndrome (FXS). However, direct experimental evidence of these
   alterations in humans with these disorders is scarce. Transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive tool for probing mechanisms
   of plasticity and metaplasticity in vivo, in humans. The aim of the
   current study was to examine mechanisms of plasticity and metaplasticity
   in humans with ASD and FXS. We employed a repetitive TMS protocol
   developed specifically to probe cortical plasticity, namely continuous
   theta burst stimulation (cTBS).
   Methods: We applied a 40-second train of cTBS to primary motor cortex
   (M1) to healthy control participants and individuals with ASD or FXS,
   and we measured the cTBS-induced modulation in motor-evoked potentials
   (MEPs) in a contralateral intrinsic hand muscle. Each participant
   completed two sessions of the same protocol on two consecutive days. The
   degree of modulation in MEPs after cTBS on the first day was evaluated
   as a putative index of cortical plasticity. Examination of the changes
   in the effects of cTBS on the second day, as conditioned by the effects
   on the first day, provided an index of metaplasticity, or the propensity
   of a given cortical region to undergo plastic change based on its recent
   history.
   Results: After a 40-second cTBS train, individuals with ASD show a
   significantly longer duration of suppression in MEP amplitude as
   compared with healthy controls, whereas individuals with FXS show a
   significantly shorter duration. After a second train of cTBS, 24 hours
   later, the ASD group was indistinguishable from the control group, and
   while in the FXS group MEPs were paradoxically facilitated by cTBS.
   Conclusion: These findings offer insights into the pathophysiology of
   ASD and FXS, specifically providing direct experimental evidence that
   humans with these disorders show distinct alterations in plasticity and
   metaplasticity, consistent with the findings in animal models. If
   confirmed in larger test-retest studies, repeated TMS measures of
   plasticity and metaplasticity may provide a valuable physiologic
   phenotype for ASD and FXS.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The role of change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point
   for randomized trials in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) has
   previously not been thoroughly evaluated.
   Study Design: Individual patient-level meta-analysis.
   Setting \& Population: Individual-patient data for 830 patients from 11
   randomized trials evaluating 4 intervention types (renin-angiotensin
   system {[}RAS] blockade, fish oil, immunosuppression, and steroids)
   examining associations between changes in urine protein and clinical end
   points at the individual and trial levels.
   Selection Criteria for Studies: Randomized controlled trials of IgAN
   with measurements of proteinuria at baseline and a median of 9 (range,
   5-12) months follow-up, with at least 1 further year of follow-up for
   the clinical outcome.
   Predictor: 9-month change in proteinuria.
   Outcome: Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or
   death.
   Results: Early decline in proteinuria at 9 months was associated with
   lower risk for the clinical outcome (HR per 50\% reduction in
   proteinuria, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.48) and was consistent across
   studies. Proportions of treatment effect on the clinical outcome
   explained by early decline in proteinuria were estimated at 11\% (95\%
   CI, 219\% to 41\%) for RAS blockade and 29\% (95\% CI, 6\% to 53\%) for
   steroid therapy. The direction of the pooled treatment effect on early
   change in proteinuria was in accord with the direction of the treatment
   effect on the clinical outcome for steroids and RAS blockade.
   Trial-level analyses estimated that the slope for the regression line
   for the association of treatment effects on the clinical end points and
   for the treatment effect on proteinuria was 2.15 (95\% Bayesian credible
   interval, 0.10-4.32).
   Limitations: Study population restricted to 11 trials, all having fewer
   than 200 patients each with a limited number of clinical events.
   Conclusions: Results of this analysis offer novel evidence supporting
   the use of an early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point
   for clinical end points in IgAN in selected settings. (C) 2016 by the

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate if optimal dose of either oral or injectable
   regimens of methotrexate (MTX) of 25mg/week was used in the comparator
   arms of studies comparing biologic drugs with MTX in rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA).
   Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in MEDLINE,
   EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases for randomised controlled
   trials comparing biologics with MTX in RA. A systematic review was
   performed among studies that met predefined criteria focusing on
   assessment of dose of MTX used in the comparator arm. Study authors were
   contacted when necessary. Study quality was assessed.
   Results A total of 3276 references were identified and 13 trials were
   included. We obtained maximal dose and regimen for all. The maximal dose
   of MTX used in the comparator arm of the trials was no more than
   20mg/week in any trial and for all but one trial, MTX was given orally
   and not by injection. The trial that used an injectable form reached a
   maximum of 15mg/week.
   Conclusions A suboptimal dose of MTX was used in biological clinical
   trials performed in RA, particularly regarding route of administration.
   This may have biased findings in favour of biological agents.}},

Abstract = {{Background Whether preradiographic lesions in knees at risk for
   osteoarthritis are incidental versus disease is unclear. We
   hypothesised, in persons without but at higher risk for knee
   osteoarthritis, that: 12-48month MRI lesion status worsening is
   associated with 12-48month incident radiographic osteoarthritis
   (objective component of clinical definition of knee osteoarthritis) and
   48-84month persistent symptoms.
   Methods In 849 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants Kellgren/Lawrence
   (KL) 0 in both knees, we assessed cartilage damage, bone marrow lesions
   (BMLs), and menisci on 12month (baseline) and 48month MRIs.
   Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations
   between 12-48month worsening versus stable status and outcome
   (12-48month incident KL 1 and KL 2, and 48-84month persistent symptoms
   defined as frequent symptoms or medication use most days of 1month in
   past 12month, at consecutive visits 48-84months), adjusting for age,
   gender, body mass index (BMI), injury and surgery.
   Results Mean age was 59.6 (8.8), BMI 26.7 (4.2) and 55.9\% were women.
   12-48month status worsening of cartilage damage, meniscal tear, meniscal
   extrusion, and BMLs was associated with 12-48month incident radiographic
   outcomes, and worsening of cartilage damage and BMLs with 48-84month
   persistent symptoms. There was a dose-response association for magnitude
   of worsening of cartilage damage, meniscal tear, meniscal extrusion, and
   BMLs and radiographic outcomes, and cartilage damage and BMLs and
   persistent symptoms.
   Conclusions In persons at higher risk, worsening MRI lesion status was
   associated with concurrent incident radiographic osteoarthritis and
   subsequent persistent symptoms. These findings suggest that such lesions
   represent early osteoarthritis, and add support for a paradigm shift
   towards investigation of intervention effectiveness at this stage.}},

Abstract = {{CM chondrites are the most common type of hydrated meteorites, making up
   similar to 1.5\% of all falls. Whereas most CM chondrites experienced
   only low-temperature (similar to 0 degrees C-120 degrees C) aqueous
   alteration, the existence of a small fraction of CM chondrites that
   suffered both hydration and heating complicates our understanding of the
   early thermal evolution of the CM parent body(ies). Here, we provide new
   constraints on the collisional and thermal history of CM-like bodies
   from a comparison between newly acquired spectral measurements of
   main-belt Ch/Cgh-type asteroids (70 objects) and existing laboratory
   spectral measurements of CM chondrites. It first appears that the
   spectral variation observed among CM-like bodies is essentially due to
   variations in the average regolith grain size. Second, the spectral
   properties of the vast majority (unheated) of CM chondrites resemble
   both the surfaces and the interiors of CM-like bodies, implying a
   ``low{''} temperature (<300 degrees C) thermal evolution of the CM
   parent body (ies). It follows that an impact origin is the likely
   explanation for the existence of heated CM chondrites. Finally,
   similarly to S-type asteroids and (2) Pallas, the surfaces of large (D >
   100 km)-supposedly primordial-Ch/Cgh-type main-belt asteroids likely
   expose the interiors of the primordial CM parent bodies, a possible
   consequence of impacts by small asteroids (D < 10 km) in the early solar
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Among the most fundamental results in the area of perceptual
   classification are the ``correlated facilitation{''} and ``filtering
   interference{''} effects observed in Garner's (1974) speeded
   categorization tasks: In the case of integral-dimension stimuli,
   relative to a control task, single-dimension classification is faster
   when there is correlated variation along a second dimension, but slower
   when there is orthogonal variation that cannot be filtered out (e.g., by
   attention). These fundamental effects may result from participants' use
   of a trial-by-trial bypass strategy in the control and correlated tasks:
   The observer changes the previous category response whenever the
   stimulus changes, and maintains responses if the stimulus repeats. Here
   we conduct modified versions of the Garner tasks that eliminate the
   availability of a pure bypass strategy. The fundamental facilitation and
   interference effects remain, but are still largely explainable in terms
   of pronounced sequential effects in all tasks. We develop
   sequence-sensitive versions of exemplar retrieval and decision-bound
   models aimed at capturing the detailed, trial-by-trial response-time
   distribution data. The models combine assumptions involving: (i)
   strengthened perceptual/memory representations of stimuli that repeat
   across consecutive trials, and (ii) a bias to change category responses
   on trials in which the stimulus changes. These models can predict our
   observed effects and provide a more complete account of the underlying
   bases of performance in our modified Garner tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The interaction between floral traits and reproductive isolation is
   crucial to explaining the extraordinary diversity of angiosperms.
   Heterostyly, a complex floral polymorphism that optimizes outcrossing,
   evolved repeatedly and has been shown to accelerate diversification in
   primroses, yet its potential influence on isolating mechanisms remains
   unexplored. Furthermore, the relative contribution of pre-versus
   postmating barriers to reproductive isolation is still debated. No
   experimental study has yet evaluated the possible effects of heterostyly
   on pre-and postmating reproductive mechanisms. We quantify multiple
   reproductive barriers between the heterostylous Primula elatior (oxlip)
   and P. vulgaris (primrose), which readily hybridize when co-occurring,
   and test whether traits of heterostyly contribute to reproductive
   barriers in unique ways. We find that premating isolation is key for
   both species, while postmating isolation is considerable only for P.
   vulgaris; ecogeographic isolation is crucial for both species, while
   phenological, seed developmental, and hybrid sterility barriers are also
   important in P. vulgaris, implicating sympatrically higher gene flow
   into P. elatior. We document for the first time that, in addition to the
   aforementioned species-dependent asymmetries, morph-dependent
   asymmetries affect reproductive barriers between heterostylous species.
   Indeed, the interspecific decrease of reciprocity between high sexual
   organs of complementary floral morphs limits interspecific pollen
   transfer from anthers of short-styled flowers to stigmas of long-styled
   flowers, while higher reciprocity between low sexual organs favors
   introgression over isolation from anthers of long-styled flowers to
   stigmas of short-styled flowers. Finally, intramorph incompatibility
   persists across species boundaries, but is weakened in long-styled
   flowers of P. elatior, opening a possible backdoor to gene flow through
   intramorph pollen transfer between species. Therefore, patterns of gene
   flow across species boundaries are likely affected by floral morph
   composition of adjacent populations. To summarize, our study highlights
   the general importance of premating isolation and newly illustrates that
   both morph-and species-dependent asymmetries shape boundaries between
   heterostylous species.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we examine whether dimensions comprising the entirety
   of an object (e.g., size and saturation) are processed independently or
   pooled into a single whole-object representation. These whole-object
   features, while notionally separable, sometimes show empirical effects
   consistent with integrality. A recently proposed theoretical distinction
   between integral and separable dimensions that emphasizes the time
   course of information processing, can be used to differentiate whether
   whole-object features are processed independently, either in serial or
   in parallel, or pooled into a single coactive process (see, e.g.,
   Little, Nosofsky, Donkin, \& Denton, 2013). The current research
   examines this theoretical distinction in the processing of 3 sets of
   whole-object-featured stimuli that vary on any pair of the dimensions of
   saturation, size, and orientation. We found that a mixture of serial and
   parallel architectures underlies the processing of whole-object
   features. These results indicate that whole-object features are
   processed independently.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveMainstream American perception often views Islamic headcovering
   as a controversial practice indicative of gender repression and norms
   violating individual rights. Practicing Muslims counter that
   headcovering expresses piety, modesty, and protection. Recent
   scholarship affirms the complexity of the practice, and reveals that the
   motivations behind donning the headscarf span the religious, social, and
   political realms for Muslim women.
   MethodsWe explore the motivations for the practice among American
   Muslims, examining the way religious, social, and political life
   interact and reinforce one another, using data from an online survey of
   1,847 Muslim-American women from 49 states.
   ResultsOur findings demonstrate that religiosity is not a monolithic
   factor, and religious practices interact with and enforce headcovering
   in complex ways. We illustrate that conventionally understood indicators
   of Islamic religiosity align along three dimensions: religious
   lifestyle, religious abstinence, and religious socialization. Elements
   of a religious lifestyle, such as praying and attending mosque as well
   as fostering connections with Islamic social networks, are more strongly
   associated with covering than practices related to abstinence or
   socialization.
   ConclusionsUltimately, our research demonstrates a more nuanced
   understanding of how different aspects of Muslim religiosity condition
   covering among Muslim-American women.}},

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Multiple numerical approaches have been developed to simulate porous
   media fluid flow and solute transport at the pore scale. These include
   1) methods that explicitly model the three-dimensional geometry of pore
   spaces and 2) methods that conceptualize the pore space as a
   topologically consistent set of stylized pore bodies and pore throats.
   In previous work we validated a model of the first type, using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes employing a standard finite
   volume method (FVM), against magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV)
   measurements of pore-scale velocities. Here we expand that validation to
   include additional models of the first type based on the lattice
   Boltzmann method (LBM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), as
   well as a model of the second type, a pore-network model (PNM). The PNM
   approach used in the current study was recently improved and
   demonstrated to accurately simulate solute transport in a
   two-dimensional experiment. While the PNM approach is computationally
   much less demanding than direct numerical simulation methods, the effect
   of conceptualizing complex three-dimensional pore geometries on solute
   transport in the manner of PNMs has not been fully determined. We apply
   all four approaches (FVM-based CFD, LBM, SPH and PNM) to simulate
   pore-scale velocity distributions and (for capable codes) nonreactive
   solute transport, and intercompare the model results. Comparisons are
   drawn both in terms of macroscopic variables (e.g., permeability, solute
   breakthrough curves) and microscopic variables (e.g., local velocities
   and concentrations). Generally good agreement was achieved among the
   various approaches, but some differences were observed depending on the
   model context. The intercomparison work was challenging because of
   variable capabilities of the codes, and inspired some code enhancements
   to allow consistent comparison of flow and transport simulations across
   the full suite of methods. This study provides support for confidence in
   a variety of pore-scale modeling methods and motivates further
   development and application of pore-scale simulation methods. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The subsolidus equilibrium phase diagrams of Ti-V, Ti-Nb and Ti-Ta
   alloys have been computed through cluster expansion, lattice dynamics
   and Monte Carlo modeling methods combined with Density Functional Theory
   total-energy calculations. Computed phase boundaries in Ti-V alloy are
   found to be in good agreement with reported CALPHAD assessed
   experimental boundaries. For Ti-Ta system, the computed phase boundaries
   agree well with CALPHAD boundaries for Ta-rich alloys. For Ti-rich
   alloys, the transformation temperatures are overestimated by up to 200
   K. In the case of Ti-Nb system, the calculated boundary of the
   bcc-solid-solution phase decreases rapidly in temperature with
   increasing Nb concentration compared to CALPHAD boundary, deviating from
   the latter by up to 600 K at 80\% Nb. Our calculation gives
   qualitatively correct hcp-solid-solution regions for all the three alloy
   systems (i.e., solubility of V/Nb/Ta in hcp Ti). A key difficulty in
   modeling these systems is the presence of mechanical instability in the
   bcc phase at high Ti concentration. In this work, we circumvent this
   difficulty by excluding structures exhibiting instability in the cluster
   expansion construction process. We find that, while such a scheme is
   often appropriate (as in the Ti-V and Ti-Ta systems), it can become
   unreliable when the result exhibit a too strong sensitivity to the
   exclusion rule used (as in the Ti-Nb system). In all systems, we find
   that the inclusion of lattice vibration effects is crucial to obtain
   even qualitative agreement with experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess if FDG PET combined with diagnostic CT improves
   diagnostic CT accuracy to detect lymph node (LN) metastasis in advanced
   cervical cancer.
   Methods. A prospective HIPAA compliant ACRIN/GOG multicenter trial was
   conducted. Patients underwent concurrent diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT
   (DCT) and PET and pelvic/abdominal lymphadenectomy. Seven independent
   blinded readers reviewed PET-DCT and DCT one-month apart Reference
   standard was surgically removed LN pathology. Accuracy values were
   calculated at participant level, correlating abdominal (right and left
   para-aortic/common iliac) and pelvic (right and left external
   iliac/obturator) LN regions with pathology, respecting laterality.
   Reader average sensitivities/specificities of PET-DCT vs. DCT were
   compared with generalized linear mixed models, and AUCs with
   Obuchowski's method.
   Results. One hundred fifty-three patients had PET-DCT and pathology.
   Forty-three of 153 patients had metastasis to abdominal LNs. Sample size
   calculation required review of the first 40 abdominal positive and 40
   randomly selected abdominal negative studies. Patients were 24 to 74
   years (48.9 +/- 10.6) old. Mean sensitivities of PET-DCT/DCT for
   detection of LN metastasis in abdomen were 0.50 (CI: 0.44, 0.56) and
   0.42 (CI: 0.36, 0.48) (p = 0.052) and in pelvis 0.83 (CI: 0.78, 0.87)
   and 0.79 (CI: 0.73, 0.83) (p = 0.15). Corresponding specificities were
   0.85 (CI: 0.80, 0.89) and 0.89 (CI: 0.84, 0.92) (p = 0.21) and 0.63 (CI:
   0.54, 0.70) and 0.62 (CI: 0.53, 0.69) (p = 0.83). Mean AUC values were
   0.70 (CI: 0.61,0.79) and 0.68 (CI: 0.59, 0.77) (p = 0.43) and 0.80 (CI:
   0.71, 0.88) and 0.76 (CI: 0.67,0.85) (p = 0.21) respectively.
   Conclusion. Addition of PET to DCT resulted-in-statistically borderline
   increase in sensitivity to detect LN metastasis in abdomen in advanced
   cervical cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the efficacy of Collaborative \& Proactive Solutions
   (CPS) in treating oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in youth by
   comparing this novel treatment to Parent Management Training (PMT), a
   well-established treatment, and a waitlist control (WLC) group. One
   hundred thirty-four youth (ages 7-14, 61.9\% male, 83.6\% White) who
   fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
   ed.) criteria for ODD were randomized to CPS, PMT, or WLC groups. ODD
   was assessed with semistructured diagnostic interviews, clinical global
   severity and improvement ratings, and parent report measures.
   Assessments were completed pretreatment, posttreatment, and at 6 months
   following treatment. Responder and remitter analyses were undertaken
   using intent-to-treat mixed-models analyses. Chronological age, gender,
   and socioeconomic status as well as the presence of comorbid attention
   deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders were examined as predictors
   of treatment outcome. Both treatment conditions were superior to the WLC
   condition but did not differ from one another in either our responder or
   remitter analyses. Approximately 50\% of youth in both active treatments
   were diagnosis free and were judged to be much or very much improved at
   posttreatment, compared to 0\% in the waitlist condition. Younger age
   and presence of an anxiety disorder predicted better treatment outcomes
   for both PMT and CPS. Treatment gains were maintained at 6-month
   follow-up. CPS proved to be equivalent to PMT and can be considered an
   evidence-based, alternative treatment for youth with ODD and their
   families.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic orbits and associated bifurcations of singularly perturbed
   state-dependent delay differential equations (DDEs) are studied when the
   profiles of the periodic orbits contain jump discontinuities in the
   singular limit. A definition of singular solution is introduced which is
   based on a continuous parametrisation of the possibly discontinuous
   limiting solution. This reduces the construction of the limiting
   profiles to an algebraic problem. A model two state-dependent DDE is
   studied in detail and periodic singular solutions are constructed with
   one and two local maxima per period. A complete characterisation of the
   conditions on the parameters for these singular solutions to exist
   facilitates an investigation of bifurcation structures in the singular
   case revealing folds and possible cusp bifurcations. Sophisticated
   boundary value techniques are used to numerically compute the
   bifurcation diagram of the state-dependent DDE when the perturbation
   parameter is close to zero. This confirms that the solutions and
   bifurcations constructed in the singular case persist when the
   perturbation parameter is nonzero, and hence demonstrates that the
   solutions constructed using our singular solution definition are useful
   and relevant to the singularly perturbed problem. Fold and cusp
   bifurcations are found very close to the parameter values predicted by
   the singular solution theory, and we also find period-doubling
   bifurcations as well as periodic orbits with more than two local maxima
   per period, and explain the alignment between the folds on different
   bifurcation branches.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a range of motor symptoms.
   Besides the cardinal symptoms (akinesia and bradykinesia, tremor and
   rigidity), PD patients show additional motor deficits, including: gait
   disturbance, impaired handwriting, grip force and speech deficits, among
   others. Some of these motor symptoms (e.g., deficits of gait, speech,
   and handwriting) have similar clinical profiles, neural substrates, and
   respond similarly to dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation
   (DBS). Here, we provide an extensive review of the clinical
   characteristics and neural substrates of each of these motor symptoms,
   to highlight precisely how PD and its medical and surgical treatments
   impact motor symptoms. In conclusion, we offer a unified framework for
   understanding the range of motor symptoms in PD. We argue that various
   motor symptoms in PD reflect dysfunction of neural structures
   responsible for action selection, motor sequencing, and coordination and
   execution of movement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Liver transplant candidates must cope with significant physiological and
   psychological challenges. The Brief COPE is a frequently used measure of
   coping behavior; however, knowledge of the scale's factor structure and
   construct validity is limited with regard to liver transplant
   candidates. This study assessed the validity of the Brief COPE in 120
   liver transplant candidates using exploratory factor analysis. Results
   revealed a 6-factor solution, only 2 of which were consistent with the
   original scale assignments. Construct validity of the 6 Brief COPE
   scales yielded in this study was demonstrated. The results indicate that
   the Brief COPE is valid, reliable, and can be meaningfully interpreted
   in liver transplant patients. Future research should confirm this factor
   structure and examine its predictive validity prior to widespread use
   among liver transplant patients. Suggestions are presented for enhancing
   the care of transplant candidates by promoting the use of adaptive
   coping mechanisms to manage distress.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsivity has been strongly linked to addictive behaviors, but can be
   operationalized in a number of ways that vary considerably in overlap,
   suggesting multidimensionality.
   This study tested the hypothesis that the latent structure among
   multiple measures of impulsivity would reflect the following three broad
   categories: impulsive choice, reflecting discounting of delayed rewards;
   impulsive action, reflecting ability to inhibit a prepotent motor
   response; and impulsive personality traits, reflecting self-reported
   attributions of self-regulatory capacity.
   The study used a cross-sectional confirmatory factor analysis of
   multiple impulsivity assessments. Participants were 1252 young adults
   (62 \% female) with low levels of addictive behavior, who were assessed
   in individual laboratory rooms at the University of Chicago and the
   University of Georgia. The battery comprised a Delay (replace hyphen
   with space) Discounting Task, Monetary Choice Questionnaire, Conners'
   Continuous Performance Test, Go/NoGo Task, Stop Signal Task, Barratt
   Impulsiveness Scale, and the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale.
   The hypothesized three-factor model provided the best fit to the data,
   although sensation seeking was excluded from the final model. The three
   latent factors were largely unrelated to each other and were variably
   associated with substance use.
   These findings support the hypothesis that diverse measures of
   impulsivity can broadly be organized into three categories that are
   largely distinct from one another. These findings warrant investigation
   among individuals with clinical levels of addictive behavior and may be
   applied to understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of these
   categories.}},

Abstract = {{Effective management of patients using warfarin is resource-intensive,
   requiring frequent in-clinic testing of the international normalized
   ratio (INR). Patient self-testing (PST) using portable at-home INR
   monitoring devices has emerged as a convenient alternative. As revealed
   by The Home INR Study (THINRS), event rates for PST were not
   significantly different from those for in-clinic high-quality
   anticoagulation management (HQACM), and a cumulative gain in quality of
   life was observed for patients undergoing PST.
   To perform a cost-utility analysis of weekly PST versus monthly HQACM
   and to examine the sensitivity of these results to testing frequency.
   In this study, 2922 patients taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation or
   mechanical heart valve, and who demonstrated PST competence, were
   randomized to either weekly PST (n = 1465) or monthly in-clinic testing
   (n = 1457). In a sub-study, 234 additional patients were randomized to
   PST once every 4 weeks (n = 116) or PST twice weekly (n = 118). The
   endpoints were quality of life (measured by the Health Utilities Index),
   health care utilization, and costs over 2 years of follow-up.
   PST and HQACM participants were similar with regard to gender, age, and
   CHADS(2) score. The total cost per patient over 2 years of follow-up was
   \$32,484 for HQACM and \$33,460 for weekly PST, representing a
   difference of \$976. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year
   gained with PST once weekly was \$5566 (95 \% CI, -\$11,490 to
   \$25,142). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was sensitive
   to testing frequency: weekly PST dominated PST twice weekly and once
   every 4 weeks. Compared to HQACM, weekly PST was associated with
   statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in
   quality of life. The ICER for weekly PST versus HQACM was well within
   accepted standards for cost-effectiveness, and was preferred over more
   or less frequent PST. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses
   of key assumptions.
   Weekly PST is a cost-effective alternative to monthly HQACM and a
   preferred testing frequency compared to twice weekly or monthly PST.}},

Abstract = {{Water scarcity is a serious global issue, affecting every continent at
   least one month out of every year. How to ensure the sustainable
   development of the water resources has become a critical topic and
   received increasing attention from researchers. Sustainable development
   is the desired future for water resources in China, but it is complicate
   to define and quantified. In this paper, our motivation is to develop a
   water strategy based on China's circumstances, which can fall into the
   framework of sustainable development. An overview of current freshwater
   resource in China is provided, based on which the future water demand
   and storage capacities are appropriately predicted by using the grey
   model. Then an integrated water strategy consisting of four measures
   (desalination, price control, storage and water transfer) has been well
   developed accordingly. These four measures are aligned under the
   consideration of efficiency, feasibility and implementation cost through
   the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Thus, for different provinces in China,
   different water strategies are proposed by practicing these four
   measures in the priority order. The goal is to guarantee that the
   balance between water supply and demand is reached. In order to validate
   the mathematical models, a sensitivity analysis of desalination decline
   rate is carried out. In addition, a discussion is made to assess the
   sustainability of our proposed strategy. In this study, we have
   demonstrated that our approach can guarantee the balance of supply and
   demand of water resource in China from now to year 2025 if the proposed
   integrated strategy will be taken into practice between years 2013-2018.

Abstract = {{We document the growth in published papers on behavioral genetics for
   5-year intervals from 1960 through 2014. We used 1861 papers published
   in Behavior Genetics to train our search strategy which, when applied to
   Ovid PsychINFO, selected more than 45,000 publications. Five trends
   stand out: (1) the number of behavioral genetic publications has grown
   enormously; nearly 20,000 papers were published in 2010-2014. (2) The
   number of human quantitative genetic (QG) publications (e.g., twin and
   adoption studies) has steadily increased with more than 3000 papers
   published in 2010-2014. (3) The number of human molecular genetic (MG)
   publications increased substantially from about 2000 in 2000-2004 to
   5000 in 2005-2009 to 9000 in 2010-2014. (4) Nonhuman publications
   yielded similar trends. (5) Although there has been exponential growth
   in MG publications, both human and nonhuman QG publications continue to
   grow. A searchable resource of this corpus of behavioral genetic papers
   is freely available online at
   http://www.teds.ac.uk/public\_datasets.htmland will be updated annually.}},

Abstract = {{This article revisits and seeks to challenge one of the most powerful
   hypotheses in the political economy scholarship: the supposedly negative
   relationship between ethnic diversity and public goods provision. We
   suggest that the relative lack of attention to politics and history
   makes much of this literature vulnerable to endogeneity problems. In
   response, we develop a state-centered approach that brings time and
   temporality to the analytical foreground. This approach addresses issues
   of reverse causality and spuriousness by examining how different
   historical trajectories of nation-state formation, and the state
   strategies and capabilities to provide public goods associated with
   each, might have shaped both contemporary diversity and public goods
   provision. Bringing in politics and history and putting the analytical
   focus on the state also allows the article to open up the debate around
   how distinct manifestations of politicized ethnicity might influence
   state provision of public goods.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying drivers of infectious disease patterns and impacts at the
   broadest scales of organisation is one of the most crucial challenges
   for modern science, yet answers to many fundamental questions remain
   elusive. These include what factors commonly facilitate transmission of
   pathogens to novel host species, what drives variation in immune
   investment among host species, and more generally what drives global
   patterns of parasite diversity and distribution? Here we consider how
   the perspectives and tools of macroecology, a field that investigates
   patterns and processes at broad spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales,
   are expanding scientific understanding of global infectious disease
   ecology. In particular, emerging approaches are providing new insights
   about scaling properties across all living taxa, and new strategies for
   mapping pathogen biodiversity and infection risk. Ultimately,
   macroecology is establishing a framework to more accurately predict
   global patterns of infectious disease distribution and emergence.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The reduction of the supply voltage is standard MOSFETs is impeded by
   the subthreshold slope, which cannot be lowered below 60 mV/decade, even
   in ideal fully-depleted devices. We review selected CMOS-compatible
   devices capable of switching more abruptly than MOSFETs, and discuss
   their merits and limitations. Tunneling FETs (TFETs) are reverse-biased
   gated PIN diodes where the gate controls the electric field in the
   interband tunneling junction. Technological solutions for improved
   performance will be described, including alternative channel materials
   and geometries, as well as a proposed paradigm shift of increasing the
   current drive by internal amplification in the bipolar-enhanced TFET.
   Other emerging sharp-switching mechanisms are reviewed, including the
   abrupt change in the polarization of ferroelectric materials, mechanical
   contact in nano-electro-mechanical systems, energy filtering of injected
   carriers, etc. Recently proposed band modulation feedback transistors
   are conceptually different from MOSFETs or TFETs. They have similar
   gated-diode configuration, but are operated in forward-bias mode.
   Electrostatic barriers are formed (via gate biasing) to prevent
   electron/hole injection into the channel until the gate or drain bias
   reaches a turn-on value. Due to bandgap modulation along the channel,
   these devices can switch abruptly (< 1 mV/decade) to a high current.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitors of EGF receptor (EGFR) have antifibrotic effects in several
   organs, but the effect of these inhibitors on the development of
   peritoneal fibrosis is unknown. Here, we explored the therapeutic effect
   of gefitinib, a specific inhibitor of EGFR, on the development and
   progression of peritoneal fibrosis in a rat model. Daily intraperitoneal
   injections of chlorhexidine gluconate induced peritoneal fibrosis,
   indicated by thickening of the submesothelial area with an accumulation
   of collagen fibrils and activation of myofibroblasts, accompanied by
   time-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR. Administration of gefitinib
   immediately after injury prevented the onset of peritoneal fibrosis and
   delayed administration after the onset of peritoneal fibrosis halted
   fibrosis progression. Gefitinib treatment abrogated the increased
   phosphorylation of EGFR, Smad3, signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3, and NF-kappa B during peritoneal fibrosis; it also
   inhibited the accompanying overproduction of TGF-beta 1 and
   proinflammatory cytokines and the infiltration of macrophages to the
   injured peritoneum. Moreover, gefitinib significantly reduced the
   peritoneal increase of CD31-positive blood vessels and vascular
   EGF-positive cells after injury. Finally, gefitinib also attenuated high
   glucose induced peritoneal fibrosis in rats and abrogated TGF-beta 1
   induced phosphorylation of Smad3 and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition of cultured human peritoneal mesothelial cells. These results
   demonstrate that EGFR contributes to peritoneal fibrosis, inflammation,
   and angiogenesis, suggesting that EGFR inhibitors may have therapeutic
   potential in attenuating peritoneal fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor growth is a complex process involving genetic mutations,
   biochemical regulations, and mechanical deformations. In this paper, a
   thermodynamics-based nonlinear poroelastic theory is established to
   model the coupling among the mechanical, chemical, and biological
   mechanisms governing avascular tumor growth. A volumetric growth law
   accounting for mechano-chemo-biological coupled effects is proposed to
   describe the development of solid tumors. The regulating roles of
   stresses and nutrient transport in the tumor growth are revealed under
   different environmental constraints. We show that the
   mechano-chemo-biological coupling triggers anisotropic and heterogeneous
   growth, leading to the formation of layered structures in a growing
   tumor. There exists a steady state in which tumor growth is balanced by
   resorption. The influence of external confinements on tumor growth is
   also examined. A phase diagram is constructed to illustrate how the
   elastic modulus and thickness of the confinements jointly dictate the
   steady state of tumor volume. Qualitative and quantitative agreements
   with experimental observations indicate the developed model is capable
   of capturing the essential features of avascular tumor growth in various
   environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cell culture (cc)-derived hepatitis B virus (HBV) can infect
   differentiated HepaRG cells, but efficient infection requires addition
   of polyethylene glycol (PEG) during inoculation. Identification of
   sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor
   enabled ccHBV infection of NTCP reconstituted HepG2 cells, although very
   little hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is produced. We found
   infection by patient serum-derived HBV (sHBV), which required
   purification of viral particles through ultracentrifugation or PEG
   precipitation, was PEG independent and much more efficient in HepaRG
   cells than in HepG2/NTCP cells. In contrast to hepatitis B e antigen
   (HBeAg), HBsAg was not a reliable marker of productive sHBV infection at
   early time points. A low HBsAg/HBeAg ratio by ccHBV-infected HepG2/NTCP
   cells was attributable to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in culture medium,
   NTCP overexpression, and HBV genotype D. HepG2/NTCP cells released more
   viral antigens than HepG2 cells after HBV genome delivery by
   adeno-associated virus, and stable expression of NTCP in a ccHBV
   producing cell line increased viral mRNAs, proteins, replicative DNA,
   and covalently closed circular DNA. NTCP protein expression in
   HepG2/NTCP cells, despite being driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter,
   was markedly increased by DMSO treatment. This at least partly explains
   ability of DMSO to promote ccHBV infection in such cell lines. In
   conclusion, NTCP appeared inefficient to mediate infection by
   serum-derived HBV. It could promote HBV RNA transcription while
   inhibiting HBsAg secretion. Efficient PEG-independent sHBV infection of
   HepaRG cells permits comparative studies of diverse clinical HBV
   isolates and will help identify additional factors on virion surface
   promoting attachment to hepatocytes.
   IMPORTANCE
   Currently in vitro infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) depends on
   cell culture-derived HBV inoculated in the presence of polyethylene
   glycol. We found patient serum-derived HBV could efficiently infect
   differentiated HepaRG cells independent of polyethylene glycol, which
   represents a more physiological infection system. Serum-derived HBV has
   poor infectivity in HepG2 cells reconstituted with sodium taurocholate
   cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), the currently accepted HBV receptor.
   Moreover, HepG2/NTCP cells secreted very little hepatitis B surface
   antigen after infection with cell culture-derived HBV, which was
   attributed to NTCP overexpression, genotype D virus, and dimethyl
   sulfoxide added to culture medium. NTCP could promote HBV RNA
   transcription, protein expression, and DNA replication in HepG2 cells
   stably transfected with HBV DNA, while dimethyl sulfoxide could increase
   NTCP protein level despite transcriptional control by a cytomegalovirus
   promoter. Therefore, this study revealed several unusual features of
   NTCP as an HBV receptor and established conditions for efficient serum
   virus infection in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{Samoans are a unique founder population with a high prevalence of
   obesity(1-3), making them well suited for identifying new genetic
   contributors to obesity(4). We conducted a genome-wide association study
   (GWAS) in 3,072 Samoans, discovered a variant, rs12513649, strongly
   associated with body mass index (BMI) (P = 5.3 x 10(-14)), and
   replicated the association in 2,102 additional Samoans (P = 1.2 x
   10(-9)). Targeted sequencing identified a strongly associated missense
   variant, rs373863828 (p.Arg457Gln), in CREBRF (meta P = 1.4 x 10(-20)).
   Although this variant is extremely rare in other populations, it is
   common in Samoans (frequency of 0.259), with an effect size much larger
   than that of any other known common BMI risk variant (1.36-1.45 kg/m(2)
   per copy of the risk-associated allele). In comparison to wild-type
   CREBRF, the Arg457Gln variant when overexpressed selectively decreased
   energy use and increased fat storage in an adipocyte cell model. These
   data, in combination with evidence of positive selection of the allele
   encoding p.Arg457Gln, support a `thrifty' variant hypothesis as a factor
   in human obesity.}},

Title = {{Healthy or unhealthy migrants? Identifying internal migration effects on

Abstract = {{Migration has been hypothesised to be selective on health but this
   healthy migrant hypothesis has generally been tested at destinations,
   and for only one type of flow, from deprived to better-off areas. The
   circulatory nature of migration is rarely accounted for. This study
   examines the relationship between different types of internal migration
   and adult mortality in Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS)
   populations in West, East, and Southern Africa, and asks how the
   processes of selection, adaptation and propagation explain the
   migration-mortality relationship experienced in these contexts. The
   paper uses longitudinal data representing approximately 900 000 adults
   living in nine sub-Saharan African HDSS sites of the INDEPTH Network.
   Event History Analysis techniques are employed to examine the
   relationship between all-cause mortality and migration status, over
   periods ranging from 3 to 14 years for a total of nearly 4.5 million
   person-years. The study confirms the importance of migration in
   explaining variation in mortality, and the diversity of the
   migration-mortality relationship over a range of rural and urban local
   areas in the three African regions. The results confirm that the pattern
   of migration-mortality relationship is not exclusively explained by
   selection but also by propagation and adaptation. Consequences for
   public health policy are drawn. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Purpose: Investigation of the treatment potential of carbon-ion
   radiation therapy in pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer.
   Methods and Materials: A phase 1/2 dose escalation study was performed.
   One hundred eighty patients (186 lesions) with locally recurrent rectal
   cancer were treated with carbon-ion radiation therapy (CIRT) (phase 1/2:
   37 and 143 patients, respectively). The relapse locations were 71 in the
   presacral region, 82 in the pelvic sidewalls, 28 in the perineum, and 5
   near the colorectal anastomosis. A 16-fraction in 4 weeks dose regimen
   was used, with total dose ranging from 67.2 to 73.6 Gy(RBE);
   RBE-weighted absorbed dose: 4.2 to 4.6 Gy(RBE)/fraction.
   Results: During phase 1, the highest total dose, 73.6 Gy(RBE), resulted
   in no grade >3 acute reactions in the 13 patients treated at that dose.
   Dose escalation was halted at this level, and this dose was used for
   phase 2, with no other grade >3 acute reactions observed. At 5 years,
   the local control and survival rates at 73.6 Gy(RBE) were 88\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 80\%-93\%) and 59\% (95\% CI, 50\%-68\%),
   respectively.
   Conclusion: Carbon-ion radiation therapy may be a safe and effective
   treatment option for locally recurrent rectal cancer and may serve as an
   alternative to surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Hormonal milieu has long been known to play an important role in
   the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aims of this study are to
   investigate the roles of menstrual and reproductive factors in relation
   to T2D risk in an occupational cohort of Chinese women; and to explore
   the role of endogenous estrogen in T2D development.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from
   16114 women (11051 premenopausal and 5063 postmenopausal) aged >= 20
   years who participated in the ongoing prospective occupational cohort
   study. Multivariable logistic regressions were modeled to evaluate the
   associations of reproductive factors with T2D risk.
   Results: Early menarche at age (<= 12 versus 15-16 years) was associated
   with increased T2D risk (odds ratio {[}OR]: 1.60, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.16-2.22). After multiple adjustment including age,
   BMI and occupation, postmenopausal status was positively associated with
   T2D risk (OR: 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.10-2.14). Reproductive life span was
   significantly associated with T2D risk (P = 0.02), albeit displaying a
   U-shape relationship. Similarly, age at menopause was also associated
   with T2D risk in the same U-shaped as with reproductive life span (P =
   0.03). Further, years since menopause (P = 0.003), but not history of
   cycle regularity and hormone use, was associated with increased T2D
   risk.
   Conclusion: Reproductive factors were associated with T2D supporting the
   notion that either a short or prolonged exposure to endogenous estrogen
   affects T2D risk in Chinese women. Reproductive factors should be added
   to risk stratification when counseling women about their risk of
   developing diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Correspondence between hair cortisol concentrations and 30-day
   integrated daily salivary and weekly urinary cortisol measures}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of cortisol production, regulation and function is of
   considerable interest and relevance given its ubiquitous role in
   virtually all aspects of physiology, health and disease risk. The
   quantification of cortisol concentration in hair has been proposed as a
   promising approach for the retrospective assessment of integrated,
   long-term cortisol production. However, human research is still needed
   to directly test and validate current assumptions about which aspects of
   cortisol production and regulation are reflected in hair cortisol
   concentrations (HCC). Here, we report findings from a validation study
   in a sample of 17 healthy adults (mean +/- SD age: 34 +/- 8.6 yrs). To
   determine the extent to which HCC captures cumulative cortisol
   production, we examined the correspondence of HCC, obtained from the
   first 1 cm scalp-near hair segment, assumed to retrospectively reflect
   1-month integrated cortisol secretion, with 30-day average salivary
   cortisol area-under-the curve (AUC) based on 3 samples collected per day
   (on awakening, +30 min, at bedtime) and the average of 4 weekly 24-h
   urinary free cortisol (UFC) assessments. To further address which
   aspects of cortisol production and regulation are best reflected in the
   HCC measure, we also examined components of the salivary measures that
   represent: (1) production in response to the challenge of awakening
   (using the cortisol awakening response {[}CAR]), and (2)
   chronobiological regulation of cortisol production (using diurnal
   slope). Finally, we evaluated the test-retest stability of each cortisol
   measure. Results indicate that HCC was most strongly associated with the
   prior 30-day integrated cortisol production measure (average salivary
   cortisol AUC) (r = 0.61, p = 0.01). There were no significant
   associations between HCC and the 30-day summary measures using CAR or
   diurnal slope. The relationship between 1-month integrated 24-h UFC and
   HCC did not reach statistical significance (r = 0.30, p = 0.28). Lastly,
   of all cortisol measures, test-retest correlations of serial measures
   were highest for HCC (month-to-month: r = 0.84, p < 0.001), followed by
   24-h UFC (week-to-week: r's between 0.59 and 0.68, ps < 0.05) and then
   integrated salivary cortisol concentrations (week-to-week: r's between
   0.38 and 0.61, p's between 0.13 and 0.01). These findings support the
   contention that HCC provides a reliable estimate of long-term integrated
   free cortisol production that is aligned with integrated salivary
   cortisol production measured over a corresponding one-month period. (C)
