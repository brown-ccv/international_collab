Abstract = {{Pulmonary edema occurs in settings of acute lung injury, in diseases,
   such as pneumonia, and in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The lung
   interendothelial junctions are maintained in part by vascular
   endothelial (VE)-cadherin, an adherens junction protein, and its surface
   expressionis regulated by endocytic trafficking. TheRab family of small
   GTPases are regulators of endocytic trafficking. The key trafficking
   pathways are regulated by Rab4, -7, and -9. Rab4 regulates the recycling
   of endosomes to the cell surface througha rapid-shuttle process, whereas
   Rab7 and -9 regulate trafficking to the late endosome/lysosome for
   degradation or from the trans-Golgi network to the late endosome,
   respectively. We recently demonstrated a role for the endosomal adaptor
   protein, p18, in regulation of the pulmonary endothelium through
   enhanced recycling of VE-cadherin to adherens junction. Thus, we
   hypothesized that Rab4, -7, and -9 regulate pulmonary endothelial
   barrier function through modulating trafficking of VE-cadherin-positive
   endosomes. We used Rab mutants with varying activities and associations
   to the endosome to study endothelial barrier function in vitro and in
   vivo. Our study demonstrates a key role for Rab4 activation and Rab9
   inhibition in regulation of vascular permeability through enhanced
   VE-cadherin expression at the interendothelial junction. We further
   showed that endothelial barrier function mediated through Rab4 is
   dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and
   activity. Thus, we demonstrate that Rab4 and -9 regulate VE-cadherin
   levels at the cell surface to modulate the pulmonary endothelium through
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent and - independent
   pathways, respectively. We propose that regulating select Rab GTPases
   represents novel therapeutic strategies for patients suffering with
   acute respiratory distress syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery has emerged internationally as a
   minimally invasive technique that can be performed in an awake patient

   endoscope have made a myriad of spine diseases accessible to the
   minimally invasive spine surgeon. The major challenge inherent in the
   surgical treatment of thoracic disc disease is that the disc herniation
   is often ventral to the spinal cord. The transforaminal approach and the
   angled endoscopic camera are an ideal combination for creating a
   technical advantage to accessing thoracic disc disease.}},

Abstract = {{Thylacoleo carnifex, or the ``pouched lion{''} (Mammalia: Marsupialia:
   Diprotodontia: Thylacoleonidae), was a carnivorous marsupial that
   inhabited Australia during the Pleistocene. Although all present-day
   researchers agree that Thylacoleo had a hypercarnivorous diet, the way
   in which it killed its prey remains uncertain. Here we use geometric
   morphometrics to capture the shape of the elbow joint (i.e., the
   anterior articular surface of the distal humerus) in a wide sample of
   extant mammals of known behavior to determine how elbow anatomy reflects
   forearm use. We then employ this information to investigate the
   predatory behavior of Thylacoleo. A principal components analysis
   indicates that Thylacoleo is the only carnivorous mammal to cluster with
   extant taxa that have an extreme degree of forearm maneuverability, such
   as primates and arboreal xenarthrans (pilosans). A canonical variates
   analysis confirms that Thylacoleo had forearm maneuverability
   intermediate between wombats (terrestrial) and arboreal mammals and a
   much greater degree of maneuverability than any living carnivoran
   placental. A linear discriminant analysis computed to separate the elbow
   morphology of arboreal mammals from terrestrial ones shows that
   Thylacoleo was primarily terrestrial but with some climbing abilities.
   We infer from our results that Thylacoleo used its forelimbs for
   grasping or manipulating prey to a much higher degree than its supposed
   extant placental counterpart, the African lion (Panthera leo). The use
   of the large and retractable claw on the semiopposable thumb of
   Thylacoleo for potentially slashing and disemboweling prey is discussed
   in the light of this new information.}},

Abstract = {{Plant perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
   other environmental stresses trigger transient ion fluxes at the plasma
   membrane. Apart from the role of Ca2+ uptake in signaling, the
   regulation and significance of PAMP-induced ion fluxes in immunity
   remain unknown. We characterized the functions of INTEGRIN-LINKED
   KINASE1 (ILK1) that encodes a Raf-like MAP2K kinase with functions
   insufficiently understood in plants. Analysis of ILK1 mutants impaired
   in the expression or kinase activity revealed that ILK1 contributes to
   plant defense to bacterial pathogens, osmotic stress sensitivity, and
   cellular responses and total ion accumulation in the plant upon
   treatment with a bacterial-derived PAMP, flg22. The calmodulin-like
   protein CML9, a negative modulator of flg22-triggered immunity,
   interacted with, and suppressed ILK1 kinase activity. ILK1 interacted
   with and promoted the accumulation of HAK5, a putative (H+)/K+ symporter
   that mediates a high-affinity uptake during K+ deficiency. ILK1 or HAK5
   expression was required for several flg22 responses including gene
   induction, growth arrest, and plasma membrane depolarization.
   Furthermore, flg22 treatment induced a rapid K+ efflux at both the plant
   and cellular levels in wild type, while mutants with impaired ILK1 or
   HAK5 expression exhibited a comparatively increased K+ loss. Taken
   together, our results position ILK1 as a link between plant defense
   pathways and K+ homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{In the flora of Australia, the driest vegetated continent, crassulacean

   photosynthetic pathway diversity, does not distinguish between plants
   with low-levels of CAM and C3 plants. We provide the first census of CAM
   for the Australian flora and suggest that the real frequency of CAM in
   the flora is double that currently known, with the number of terrestrial
   CAM species probably 10-fold greater. Still unresolved is the question
   why the large stem-succulent life form is absent from the native
   Australian flora even though exotic large cacti have successfully
   invaded and established in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a reporting guideline to provide authors with guidance
   about what should be reported when writing a paper for publication in a
   scientific journal using a particular type of research design: the
   single-case experimental design. This report describes the methods used
   to develop the Single-Case Reporting guideline In BEhavioural
   interventions (SCRIBE) 2016. As a result of 2 online surveys and a 2-day
   meeting of experts, the SCRIBE 2016 checklist was developed, which is a
   set of 26 items that authors need to address when writing about
   single-case research. This article complements the more detailed SCRIBE
   2016 Explanation and Elaboration article (Tate et al., 2016) that
   provides a rationale for each of the items and examples of adequate
   reporting from the literature. Both these resources will assist authors
   to prepare reports of single-case research with clarity, completeness,
   accuracy, and transparency. They will also provide journal reviewers and
   editors with a practical checklist against which such reports may be
   critically evaluated. We recommend that the SCRIBE 2016 is used by
   authors preparing manuscripts describing single-case research for
   publication, as well as journal reviewers and editors who are evaluating
   such manuscripts. Scientific abstract: Reporting guidelines, such as the
   Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement, improve
   the reporting of research in the medical literature (Turner et al.,
   2012). Many such guidelines exist and the CONSORT Extension to
   Nonpharmacological Trials (Boutron et al., 2008) provides suitable
   guidance for reporting between-groups intervention studies in the
   behavioral sciences. The CONSORT Extension for N-of-1 Trials (CENT 2015)
   was developed for multiple crossover trials with single individuals in
   the medical sciences (Shamseer et al., 2015; Vohra et at, 2015), but
   there is no reporting guideline in the CONSORT tradition for single-case
   research used in the behavioral sciences. We developed the Single-Case
   Reporting guideline In BEhavioural interventions (SCRIBE) 2016 to meet
   this need. This Statement article describes the methodology of the
   development of the SCRIBE 2016, along with the outcome of 2 Delphi
   surveys and a consensus meeting of experts. We present the resulting
   26-item SCRIBE 2016 checklist The article complements the more detailed
   SCRIBE 2016 Explanation and Elaboration article (Tate et al., 2016) that
   provides a rationale for each of the items and examples of adequate
   reporting from the literature. Both these resources will assist authors
   to prepare reports of single-case research with clarity, completeness,
   accuracy, and transparency. They will also provide journal reviewers and

Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},

Volume = {{210}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1418-1429}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Corystosperms, a key extinct group of Late Permian to Early Cretaceous
   plants, are important for understanding seed plant phylogeny, including
   the evolution of the angiosperm carpel and anatropous bitegmic ovule.
   Here, we describe a new species of corystosperm seed-bearing organ,
   Umkomasia mongolica sp. nov., based on hundreds of three-dimensionally
   preserved mesofossils from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia.
   Individual seed-bearing units of U. mongolica consist of a bract
   subtending an axis that bifurcates, with each fork (cupule stalk)
   bearing a cupule near the tip. Each cupule is formed by the strongly
   reflexed cupule stalk and two lateral flaps that partially enclose an
   erect seed. The seed is borne at, or close to, the tip of the reflexed
   cupule stalk, with the micropyle oriented towards the stalk base.
   The corystosperm cupule is generally interpreted as a modified leaf that
   bears a seed on its abaxial surface. However, U. mongolica suggests that
   an earlier interpretation, in which the seed is borne directly on an
   axis (shoot), is equally likely. The `axial' interpretation suggests a
   possible relationship of corystosperms to Ginkgo. It also suggests that
   the cupules of corystosperms may be less distinct from those of Caytonia
   than has previously been supposed.}},

Journal = {{BIOMETRICS}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{402-413}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Causal mediation modeling has become a popular approach for studying the
   effect of an exposure on an outcome through a mediator. However, current
   methods are not applicable to the setting with a large number of
   mediators. We propose a testing procedure for mediation effects of
   high-dimensional continuous mediators. We characterize the marginal
   mediation effect, the multivariate component-wise mediation effects, and
   the L2 norm of the component-wise effects, and develop a Monte-Carlo
   procedure for evaluating their statistical significance. To accommodate
   the setting with a large number of mediators and a small sample size, we
   further propose a transformation model using the spectral decomposition.
   Under the transformation model, mediation effects can be estimated using
   a series of regression models with a univariate transformed mediator,
   and examined by our proposed testing procedure. Extensive simulation
   studies are conducted to assess the performance of our methods for
   continuous and dichotomous outcomes. We apply the methods to analyze
   genomic data investigating the effect of microRNA miR-223 on a
   dichotomous survival status of patients with glioblastoma multiforme
   (GBM). We identify nine gene ontology sets with expression values that
   significantly mediate the effect of miR-223 on GBM survival.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Renal fibrosis can be induced in different renal diseases, but
   ultimately progresses to end stage renal disease. Although the
   pathophysiologic process of renal fibrosis have not been fully
   elucidated, it is characterized by glomerulosclerosis and/or tubular
   interstitial fibrosis, and is believed to be caused by the proliferation
   of renal inherent cells, including glomerular epithelial cells,
   mesangial cells, and endothelial cells, along with defective kidney
   repair, renal interstitial fibroblasts activation, and extracellular
   matrix deposition. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulate a variety
   of cell physiological processes, including metabolism, growth,
   differentiation, and survival. Many studies from in vitro and animal
   models have provided evidence that RTKs play important roles in the
   pathogenic process of renal fibrosis. It is also showed that tyrosine
   kinases inhibitors (TKIs) have anti-fibrotic effects in basic research
   and clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the evidence for
   involvement of specific RTKs in renal fibrosis process and the
   employment of TKIs as a therapeutic approach for renal fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{Ten years after the consensus meeting on disorders of sex development
   (DSD), genital surgery continues to raise questions and criticisms
   concerning its indications, its technical aspects, timing and
   evaluation. This standpoint details each distinct situation and its
   possible management in 5 main groups of DSD patients with atypical
   genitalia: the 46, XX DSD group (congenital adrenal hyperplasia); the
   heterogeneous 46, XY DSD group (gonadal dysgenesis, disorders of
   steroidogenesis, target tissues impairments.); gonosomic mosaicisms (45,
   X/46, XY patients); ovotesticular DSD; and ``non-hormonal/non
   chromosomal{''} DSD. Questions are summarized for each DSD group with
   the support of literature and the feedback of several world experts.
   Given the complexity and heterogeneity of presentation there is no
   consensus regarding the indications, the timing, the procedure nor the
   evaluation of outcome of DSD surgery. There are, however, some issues on
   which most experts would agree: 1) The need for identifying centres of
   expertise with a multidisciplinary approach; 2) A conservative
   management of the gonads in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome at
   least until puberty although some studies expressed concerns about the
   heightened tumour risk in this group; 3) To avoid vaginal dilatation in
   children after surgical reconstruction; 4) To keep asymptomatic
   mullerian remnants during childhood; 5) To remove confirmed streak
   gonads when Y material is present; 6) It is likely that 46, XY cloacal
   exstrophy, aphallia and severe micropenis would do best raised as male
   although this is based on limited outcome data. There is general
   acknowledgement among experts that timing, the choice of the individual
   and irreversibility of surgical procedures are sources of concerns.
   There is, however, little evidence provided regarding the impact of
   non-treated DSD during childhood for the individual development, the
   parents, society and the risk of stigmatization. The low level of
   evidence should lead to design collaborative prospective studies
   involving all parties and using consensual protocols of evaluation.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{To explore the limits of quantification as a form of rationalization, we
   examine a rare case of dequantification: race-based affirmative action
   in undergraduate admissions at the University of Michigan. Michigan
   adopted a policy of holistically reviewing undergraduate applications in
   2003, after the US Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional its points-based
   admissions policy. Using archival and ethnographic data, we trace the
   adoption, evolution, and undoing of Michigan's quantified system of
   admissions decision-making between 1964 and 2004. In a context in which
   opponents of the system had legal avenues to engage a powerful outside
   authority, we argue that three internal features of the University's
   quantified admissions policy contributed to its demise: its
   transparency, the instability of the categories it quantified, and the
   existence of qualitative alternatives. Our analysis challenges the
   presumed durability and inevitability of quantification by identifying
   its vulnerabilities and suggests that quantification should be
   understood as a matter of degree rather than a simple binary.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammation contributes to the evolution of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain
   injury. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein that is
   translocated from the nucleus and released after ischemia in adult
   rodents and thereby initiates inflammatory responses. However, there is
   very little information regarding the effects of HI on HMGB1 in immature
   brains. To investigate the effects of HI on HMGB1 in the term-equivalent
   fetal brain, ovine fetuses at 127 days gestation were studied after 30
   minutes of carotid occlusion. Groups were sham-control and ischemia with
   48 hours and ischemia with 72 hours of reperfusion. By
   immunohistochemistry, HMGB1 was found to be localized primarily in cell
   nuclei and partially in cytoplasmic compartments in the cerebral cortex
   of controls. Ischemia increased the area fraction of neuronal cells with
   cytoplasmic HMGB1 staining, and Western immunoblot revealed that
   cytosolic HMGB1 expression increased after ischemia (p < 0.05) and
   decreased in nuclei in ischemic versus the sham-control brains (p <
   0.05). These data indicate that HMGB1 translocates from the nuclear to
   cytosolic compartments after ischemic brain injury in fetal sheep. This
   translocation may enable the action of HMGB1 as a proinflammatory
   cytokine that contributes to HI injury in the developing brain.}},

Title = {{Age differences in learning emerge from an insufficient representation
   of uncertainty in older adults}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Healthy aging can lead to impairments in learning that affect many
   laboratory and real-life tasks. These tasks often involve the
   acquisition of dynamic contingencies, which requires adjusting the rate
   of learning to environmental statistics. For example, learning rate
   should increase when expectations are uncertain (uncertainty), outcomes
   are surprising (surprise) or contingencies are more likely to change
   (hazard rate). In this study, we combine computational modelling with an
   age-comparative behavioural study to test whether age-related learning
   deficits emerge from a failure to optimize learning according to the
   three factors mentioned above. Our results suggest that learning
   deficits observed in healthy older adults are driven by a diminished
   capacity to represent and use uncertainty to guide learning. These
   findings provide insight into age-related cognitive changes and
   demonstrate how learning deficits can emerge from a failure to
   accurately assess how much should be learned.}},

Abstract = {{Current generation low-frequency interferometers constructed with the
   objective of detecting the high-redshift 21 cm background aim to
   generate power spectra of the brightness temperature contrast of neutral
   hydrogen in primordial intergalactic medium. Two-dimensional (2D) power
   spectra (power in Fourier modes parallel and perpendicular to the line
   of sight) that formed from interferometric visibilities have been shown
   to delineate a boundary between spectrally smooth foregrounds (known as
   the wedge) and spectrally structured 21 cm background emission (the EoR
   window). However, polarized foregrounds are known to possess spectral
   structure due to Faraday rotation, which can leak into the EoR window.
   In this work we create and analyze 2D power spectra from the PAPER-32
   imaging array in Stokes I, Q, U, and V. These allow us to observe and
   diagnose systematic effects in our calibration at high signal-to-noise
   within the Fourier space most relevant to EoR experiments. We observe
   well-defined windows in the Stokes visibilities, with Stokes Q, U, and V
   power spectra sharing a similar wedge shape to that seen in Stokes I.
   With modest polarization calibration, we see no evidence that
   polarization calibration errors move power outside the wedge in any
   Stokes visibility to the noise levels attained. Deeper integrations will
   be required to confirm that this behavior persists to the depth required
   for EoR detection.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The human microbiome plays a key role in health and disease.
   Thanks to comparative metatranscriptomics, the cellular functions that
   are deregulated by the microbiome in disease can now be computationally
   explored. Unlike gene-centric approaches, pathway-based methods provide
   a systemic view of such functions; however, they typically consider each
   pathway in isolation and in its entirety. They can therefore overlook
   the key differences that (i) span multiple pathways, (ii) contain
   bidirectionally deregulated components, (iii) are confined to a pathway
   region. To capture these properties, computational methods that reach
   beyond the scope of predefined pathways are needed.
   Results: By integrating an existing module discovery algorithm into
   comparative metatranscriptomic analysis, we developed metaModules, a
   novel computational framework for automated identification of the key
   functional differences between health-and disease-associated
   communities. Using this framework, we recovered significantly
   deregulated subnetworks that were indeed recognized to be involved in
   two well-studied, microbiome-mediated oral diseases, such as butanoate
   production in periodontal disease and metabolism of sugar alcohols in
   dental caries. More importantly, our results indicate that our method
   can be used for hypothesis generation based on automated discovery of
   novel, disease-related functional subnetworks, which would otherwise
   require extensive and laborious manual assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical studies of lymphoid malignancies (LMs) have suggested that the
   descriptive patterns of LMs differ in East Asia compared to Western
   populations. However, there are very limited available data on
   population-based, subtype-specific incidence rates of LMs in the East
   Asian population, particularly in Chinese. Using data from the Hong Kong
   (HK) Cancer Registry and United States (U.S.) SEER Program, we
   calculated and compared age-adjusted incidence rates of LM subtypes in
   HK to those in Whites and Asians living in the U.S. Overall and
   sex-specific rates were calculated for the period 2001-2010. The
   incidence of most subtypes was low in the HK population, with rates <1
   case per 100,000 for all subtypes except for diffuse large B-cell
   lymphoma (3.26/100,000) and plasma cell neoplasms (1.99/100,000).
   Age-adjusted incidence rates of all evaluated B-cell subtypes were
   significantly higher in U.S. Whites compared to HK, with standardized
   rate ratios (SRRs) ranging from 1.6 (Burkitt lymphoma) to 9.1 (chronic
   lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma). Rates in U.S. Asians
   were generally intermediate to those in U.S. Whites and HK. Conversely,
   rates of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma were significantly lower in both
   U.S. Whites (SRR = 0.2) and U.S. Asians (SRR = 0.5) compared to HK. Our
   data provide new insight into the subtype-specific patterns of LMs in
   the Chinese population, and suggest the need for etiological studies of
   LMs in the East Asian population to elucidate the factors responsible
   for these differences in the geographic incidence patterns. Published by

Abstract = {{Remote sensing is a valuable way to retrieve spatially continuous
   information on vegetation phenological changes, which are widely used as
   an indicator of climate change. We propose a simple method called
   weighted cross-correlogram spectral matching-phenology (CCSM-P), which
   combines CCSM and a weighted correlation system, for detecting
   vegetation phenological changes by using multiyear vegetation index (VI)
   time series. In experiments with simulated enhanced VI (EVI) for various
   scenarios, CCSM-P exhibited high accuracy and robustness to noise and
   the potential to capture long-term phenological change trends. For a
   temperate grassland in northern China, CCSM-P retrieved more reasonable
   vegetation spring phenology fromModerate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) EVI images than the MODIS phenology product
   (MCD12Q2). When validated against field phenological observations in
   five of the AmeriFlux Network sites in the U.S. (four deciduous
   broadleaf forest sites and a closed shrublands site), and a cropland
   site in China, CCSM-P exhibited mean absolute differences (MADs) ranging
   from 2 to 10 days (median: 4.2 days), whereas MAD of non-CCSM methods
   showed larger variations, ranging from 5 to 58 days (median: 21.3 days).
   This is because CCSM-P integrates field phenological observations.
   Compared with non-CCSM methods, which are widely used to identify
   phenological events, CCSM-P is more accurate and less dependent on prior
   knowledge (thresholds or predefined functions), which indicates its
   effectiveness and applicability for detecting year-to-year variations
   and long-term change trends in phenology, and should facilitate more
   reliable assessments of phenological changes in climate change studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background:Studies describing the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and
   ulcerative colitis (UC) are uncommon in the United States. We sought to
   determine the incidence of CD and UC in the state of Rhode
   Island.Methods:The Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry is a
   state-based inception cohort of patients newly diagnosed with
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Rhode Island. To confirm a diagnosis
   of CD, UC, or IBD unclassified (IBDU), the National Institute of
   Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases IBD Genetics Consortium
   criteria were applied in a review of medical records from
   gastroenterology practices located in the state of Rhode Island and
   adjacent to the Rhode Island border in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
   Using population-based data, we determined the statewide incidence of
   IBD in Rhode Island from 2008 to 2010.Results:A total of 971 Rhode
   Island residents were diagnosed with IBD, including 444 with CD, 486
   with UC, and 41 with IBD unclassified from 2008 to 2010. The overall
   age- and sex-adjusted IBD incidence was 30.2 (95\% confidence interval,
   28.3-32.1) per 100,000 persons in this time frame with 13.9, 15.1, and
   1.3 per 100,000 diagnosed with CD, UC, and IBD unclassified,
   respectively. Of the total incident cases in Rhode Island, 30\% (n =
   291) were enrolled in Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry for
   follow-up.Conclusions:The incidence of IBD in Rhode Island is higher
   than that previously reported by other population-based cohorts in the
   United States. Prospective follow-up of individuals enrolled in the
   community-based Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry cohort is
   ongoing.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the global presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a paucity
   of treatment services exists in Tanzania and other low- and
   middle-income countries. The effect of delayed or low- quality
   treatments is enduring and contributes to lifelong variability in
   ASD-related functional impairments. Service disparities in Tanzania
   derive in part from a widespread lack of national ASD knowledge.
   Historically, in Western countries, parents have played a major role in
   increasing ASD awareness, advancing research, and encouraging
   empirically supported treatments. In the absence of established
   treatment services, parents of children with ASD have also learned to
   implement behavioral interventions to reduce the widening skills gaps.
   This article describes the development of an intervention designed to
   inform parents in Tanzania about ASD and empirically supported
   behavioral strategies. Preliminary data, collected from a clinical
   implementation with 29 Tanzanian families of children diagnosed with ASD
   or general developmental delays, support the initial feasibility and
   acceptability of this intervention. This brief intervention may help to
   ameliorate treatment disparities due to insufficient regional knowledge,
   language barriers, or limited service availability and may help improve
   functional outcomes among Tanzanian children with ASD.}},

Abstract = {{We performed time-lag analysis on the X-ray light curves of Centaurus A
   (Cen A) obtained by the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) aboard the Monitor of
   All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) in three energy bands (2-4 keV, 4-10 keV, and
   10-20 keV). We discovered a soft X-ray lag relative to higher energies
   (soft lag) on a timescale of days in a flaring episode by employing the
   discrete correlation function (DCF) and the z-transformed discrete
   correlation function (ZDCF) method. In the episode, a peak and a
   centroid in the DCF and the ZDCF was observed at a soft lag of similar
   to 5 d in 2-4 keV versus 4-10 keV and in 4-10 keV versus 10-20 keV, and
   similar to 10 d in 2-4 keV versus 10-20 keV. We found it difficult to
   explain the observed X-ray variation by a single energy injection with
   the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, in which the soft
   lags in these three energy bands reflect the different cooling times of
   the relativistic electrons, by assuming the magnetic field and minimum
   Lorentz factor estimated from a broad-band spectral energy distribution.
   Alternatively, if the phenomenon is interpreted as cooling of
   Comptonizing electrons in a corona covering the accretion disk, the
   temperature of the corona producing the variable X-rays should be
   similar to 10 keV for reconciliation with the soft lag in the energy
   range of 2-20 keV.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To provide information from a literature review about the
   prevention, recognition, and treatment for contact dermatitis.
   TARGET AUDIENCE: This continuing education activity is intended for
   physicians and nurses with an interest in skin and wound care.
   OBJECTIVES: After participating in this educational activity, the
   participant should be better able to: 1. Identify signs and symptoms of
   and diagnostic measures for contact dermatitis. 2. Identify causes and
   risks for contact dermatitis. 3. Select appropriate treatment for
   contact dermatitis and its prevention.
   ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Contact dermatitis to wound care products is a
   common, often neglected problem. A review was conducted to identify
   articles relevant to contact dermatitis. METHODS: A PubMed
   English-language literature review was conducted for appropriate
   articles published between January 2000 and December 2015. RESULTS:
   Contact dermatitis is both irritant (80\% of cases) or allergic (20\% of
   cases). Frequent use of potential contact allergens and impaired barrier
   function of the skin can lead to rising sensitization in patients with
   chronic wounds. Common known allergens to avoid in wound care patients
   include fragrances, colophony, lanolin, and topical antibiotics.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be cognizant of the allergens in wound
   care products and the potential for sensitization. All medical devices,
   including wound dressings, adhesives, and bandages, should be labeled
   with their complete ingredients, and manufacturers should be encouraged
   to remove common allergens from wound care products, including topical
   creams, ointments, and dressings.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to determine the effects of Candida
   albicans respiratory tract colonization on Acinetobacter baumannii
   pneumonia in a rat model. Rats were colonized with C. albicans by
   instillation of 3 x 10(6) CFU into their airways, while sterile saline
   was instilled in the control group. The colonized rats were further
   divided into two groups: treated with amphotericin B or not. The rats
   were subsequently infected with A. baumannii (10(8) CFU by
   tracheobronchial instillation). A. baumannii lung CFU counts, cytokine
   lung levels, and rates of A. baumannii pneumonia were compared between
   groups. In vitro expression of A. baumannii virulence genes was measured
   by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR after 24-hour incubation with C.
   albicans or with Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth alone. Rats with Candida
   colonization developed A. baumannii pneumonia more frequently and had
   higher A. baumannii CFU burdens and heavier lungs than controls. After
   A. baumannii infection, lung interleukin 17 (IL-17) concentrations were
   lower and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) concentrations were higher in
   Candida-colonized rats than in controls. Candida-colonized rats treated
   with amphotericin B had a decreased rate of A. baumannii pneumonia and
   lower IFN-gamma levels but higher IL-17 levels than untreated rats.
   Expression of basC, barB, bauA, ptk, plc2, and pld2 was induced while
   expression of ompA and abaI was suppressed in A. baumannii cultured in
   the presence of C. albicans. C. albicans colonization facilitated the
   development of A. baumannii pneumonia in a rat model. Among
   Candida-colonized rats, antifungal treatment lowered the incidence of A.
   baumannii pneumonia. These findings could be due to modification of the
   host immune response and/or expression of A. baumannii virulence genes
   by Candida spp.}},

Abstract = {{Greater understanding of cognitive function in children and adolescents
   with bipolar disorder (BD) is of critical importance to improve our
   ability to design targeted treatments to help with real-world
   impairment, including academic performance. We sought to evaluate
   cognitive performance among children with either BD type I, II, or ``not
   otherwise specified{''} (NOS) participating in multi-site Course and
   Outcome of Bipolar Youth study compared to typically developing controls
   (TDC) without psychopathology. In particular, we sought to test the
   hypothesis that BD-I and BD-II youths with full threshold episodes of
   mania or hypomania would have cognitive deficits, including in reversal
   learning, vs. those BD-NOS participants with sub-threshold episodes and
   TDCs. N = 175 participants (BD-I = 81, BD-II = 11, BD-NOS = 28, TDC =
   55) completed Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Testing Battery
   (CANTAB) tasks. A priori analyses of the simple reversal stage of the
   CANTAB intra-/extra-dimensional shift task showed that aggregated
   BD-I/II participants required significantly more trials to complete the
   task than either BD-NOS participants with sub-syndromal manic/hypomanic
   symptoms or than TDCs. BD participants across sub-types had impairments
   in sustained attention and information processing for emotionally
   valenced words. Our results align with prior findings showing that
   BD-I/II youths with distinct episodes have specific alterations in
   reversal learning. More broadly, our study suggests that further work is
   necessary to see the interaction between neurocognitive performance and
   longitudinal illness course. Additional work is required to identify the
   neural underpinnings of these differences as targets for potential novel
   treatments, such as cognitive remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing debates in the Earth, planetary, and social sciences examine the
   merits and implications of traces in the stratigraphic record that would
   indicate that humans are now one of the `great forces of nature'.
   Candidates for key marker horizons in such a stratal section include
   noted changes in carbon and nitrogen concentrations, plastics,
   radionuclides, and metals. Candidates for determining calendar age,
   include the tipping point in land cover from wildlands to agriculture
   and the first nuclear detonation. Here we offer a critical review of
   recent literature contributing to delineating an Anthropogenic stratum,
   by exploring their interpretation as initiating, sustaining, or indeed
   ending an Anthropocene epoch. We also offer a reflection on the layer
   not representing a new period, any more than, for instance, iridium
   marks a `meteoritic' epoch between the Cretaceous and Palaeogene. We
   examine temporal scales for their accord with geological methods of
   definition and delineation, and for the opportunities and constraints
   each presents for understanding and responding to transformations in the
   Earth system. Our thesis is that increasingly fortified stances on the
   `right' definition of the Anthropocene epoch follow traditions of linear
   and authoritarian historical accounts, and prevent discovering epistemes
   of human-environment interactions that are open for coexistence. The
   co-existence of many key transitions will sustain ongoing and fruitful
   deliberations over human-environment interactions that the Anthropocene
   proposal has initiated, promoting research that can work with the many
   scales, discourses, and narratives of environmental change. (C) 2016

Title = {{Transgenic expression of non-structural genes of Theiler's virus
   suppresses initial viral replication and pathogenesis of demyelination}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis
   virus (TMEV) in susceptible SJL/J mice induces an immune-mediated
   demyelinating disease and has extensively been used as a relevant
   infectious model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Infection of the host with
   many other viruses also leads to acute or chronic inflammatory diseases
   in the central nervous system (CNS). Levels of viral load in the host
   often play a critical role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced
   diseases. Thus, the inhibition of viral replication in the host against
   a broad spectrum of similar viruses is critically important for
   preventing the viral pathogenicity.
   Methods: P2/P3-expressing transgenic (B6 X SJL)F1 founders were
   generated and bred onto the C57BL/6 and SJL/J backgrounds. Differences
   in the development of demyelinating disease were compared. Viral
   persistence, cytokine production, and immune responses in the CNS of
   infected control and P2/P3-Tg mice were analyzed after infection using
   quantitative PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. Various cell types from the
   control and P2/P3-Tg mice, as well as cells transfected in vitro with
   the P2 and/or P3 regions, were also analyzed for viral replication and
   innate cytokine production.
   Results: P2/P3-transgenic (P2/P3-Tg) mice carrying the viral
   non-structural protein genes displayed significantly reduced
   virus-specific T cell responses in the CNS against both the structural
   and non-structural proteins. Consequently, viral loads in the CNS were
   greater in the Tg mice during the chronic infection. However, P2/P3-Tg
   SJL mice exhibited reduced disease incidence and less severe clinical
   symptoms than did their non-transgenic littermates. Interestingly,
   P2/P3-Tg mice showed low viral loads in the CNS at a very early period
   after infection (1-3 days) with TMEV and related EMCV but not unrelated
   VSV. Cells from P2/P3-Tg mice and cells transfected with the P2 and/or
   P3 regions in vitro yielded also lower viral replication but higher
   IFN-alpha/beta production.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the expression of viral
   non-structural genes in mice inhibits initial viral replication and
   suppresses sustaining pathogenic anti-viral immune responses to broad
   viral determinants. It appears that the elevation of innate immune
   cytokines produced in the cells expressing the non-structural viral
   genes upon viral infection is responsible for the inhibitions. The
   inhibition is partially virus-specific as it is more efficient for a
   related virus compared to an unrelated virus, suggesting a role for the
   similarity in the viral genome structures. Therefore, the expression of
   viral non-structural genes may serve as a useful new method to prevent a
   broadly virus-specific pathogenesis in the hosts.}},

Title = {{Water management and livelihood choices in southwestern Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES}},

Pages = {{134-145}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Coastal Bangladesh faces an increasing number of challenges including
   cyclones, tidal surges, floods, drought, saline water intrusion,
   waterlogging and land subsidence, which pose substantial threats to the
   livelihoods of the coastal inhabitants. In addition to these threats,
   profound social and land-use changes are complicating the livelihoods of
   resource users in the region, including the introduction of aquaculture
   and increasing competition for ground and surface water sources. The
   government of Bangladesh has targeted this region for investment with
   irrigation expansion. This paper uses a sustainable livelihood lens to
   understand the role of investments in water management and irrigation in
   driving and shaping livelihood changes and transitions over the past ten
   years and offers recommendations for investments. We find that while
   water infrastructure development has greatly enhanced the role of
   agriculture in coastal livelihoods over the last 10 years, further
   development of irrigation infrastructure should only be prioritized
   after issues of water governance and inequity across agricultural and
   aquacultural livelihoods are addressed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Monodisperse Cu nanoparticles (NPs) assembled on a pyridinic-N rich

   1:1, the C2H4 formation Faradaic efficiency and hydrocarbon selectivity
   reach 19\% and 79\% respectively at -0.9 V (vs reversible hydrogen
   electrode). The p-NG itself can catalyze the CO2 reduction to formate,
   but in the composite p-NG-Cu structure, the pyridinic-N functions as a
   CO2 and proton absorber, facilitating hydrogenation and carbon-carbon

Title = {{White Matter Hyperintensities Are a Core Feature of Alzheimer's Disease:
   Evidence from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{929-939}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of increased
   signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that most
   commonly reflect small vessel cerebrovascular disease. Increased WMH
   volume is associated with risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). These observations are typically interpreted as evidence that
   vascular abnormalities play an additive, independent role contributing
   to symptom presentation, but not core features of AD. We examined the
   severity and distribution of WMH in presymptomatic PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP
   mutation carriers to determine the extent to which WMH manifest in
   individuals genetically determined to develop AD.
   Methods: The study comprised participants (n = 299; age = 39.03 +/-
   10.13) from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, including 184
   (61.5\%) with a mutation that results in AD and 115 (38.5\%)
   first-degree relatives who were noncarrier controls. We calculated the
   estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) by subtracting the
   affected parent's symptom onset age from the participant's age. Baseline
   MRI data were analyzed for total and regional WMH. Mixed-effects
   piece-wise linear regression was used to examine WMH differences between
   carriers and noncarriers with respect to EYO.
   Results: Mutation carriers had greater total WMH volumes, which appeared
   to increase approximately 6 years before expected symptom onset. Effects
   were most prominent for the parietal and occipital lobe, which showed
   divergent effects as early as 22 years before estimated onset.
   Interpretation: Autosomal-dominant AD is associated with increased WMH
   well before expected symptom onset. The findings suggest the possibility
   that WMHs are a core feature of AD, a potential therapeutic target, and
   a factor that should be integrated into pathogenic models of the
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a reporting guideline to provide authors with guidance
   about what should be reported when writing a paper for publication in a
   scientific journal using a particular type of research design: the
   single-case experimental design. This report describes the methods used
   to develop the Single-Case Reporting guideline In BEhavioural
   interventions (SCRIBE) 2016. As a result of 2 online surveys and a 2-day
   meeting of experts, the SCRIBE 2016 checklist was developed, which is a
   set of 26 items that authors need to address when writing about
   single-case research. This article complements the more detailed SCRIBE
   2016 Explanation and Elaboration article (Tate et al., 2016) that
   provides a rationale for each of the items and examples of adequate
   reporting from the literature. Both these resources will assist authors
   to prepare reports of single-case research with clarity, completeness,
   accuracy, and transparency. They will also provide journal reviewers and
   editors with a practical checklist against which such reports may be
   critically evaluated. We recommend that the SCRIBE 2016 is used by
   authors preparing manuscripts describing single-case research for
   publication, as well as journal reviewers and editors who are evaluating
   such manuscripts.}},

Title = {{Impact of Common Diabetes Risk Variant in MTNR1B on Sleep, Circadian,

Abstract = {{The risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increased by abnormalities in sleep
   quantity and quality, circadian alignment, and melatonin regulation. A
   common genetic variant in a receptor for the circadian-regulated hormone
   melatonin (MTNR1B) is associated with increased fasting blood glucose
   and risk of T2D, but whether sleep or circadian disruption mediates this
   risk is unknown. We aimed to test if MTNR1B diabetes risk variant
   rs10830963 associates with measures of sleep or circadian physiology in
   intensive in laboratory protocols (n = 58-96) or cross-sectional studies
   with sleep quantity and quality and timing measures from self-report (n
   = 4,307-10,332), actigraphy (n = 1,513), or polysomnography (n = 3,021).
   In the in-laboratory studies, we found a significant association with a
   substantially longer duration of elevated melatonin levels (41 min) and
   delayed circadian phase of dim-light melatonin offset (1.37 h),
   partially mediated through delayed offset of melatonin synthesis.
   Furthermore, increased T2D risk in MTNR1B risk allele carriers was more
   pronounced in early risers versus late risers as determined by 7 days of
   actigraphy. Our results provide the surprising insight that the MTNR1B
   risk allele influences dynamics of melatonin secretion, generating a
   novel hypothesis that the MTNR1B risk allele may extend the duration of
   endogenous melatonin production later into the morning and that early
   waking may magnify the diabetes risk conferred by the risk allele.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Research into the active ingredients of behavioral
   interventions for alcohol use disorders (AUD) has focused upon
   treatment-specific factors, often yielding disappointing results. The
   present study examines common factors of change in motivational
   enhancement therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and 12-Step
   facilitation therapy by (1) estimating transitional probabilities
   between therapist behaviors and subsequent client Change (CT) and
   Sustain (ST) Talk and (2) examining therapist skillfulness as a
   potential predictor of transition probability magnitude. Design
   Secondary data analysis examined temporal associations in therapy
   dialogues. Setting United States: data were from Project MATCH (Matching
   Alcoholism Treatments to Client Homogeneity) (1997). Participants One
   hundred and twenty-six participants who received motivational
   enhancement therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy or 12-Step
   facilitation therapy. Measurements Therapist behaviors were measured in
   three categories (exploring, teaching, connecting) and client statements
   included five categories (CT-distal, ST-distal, CT-proximal,
   ST-proximal, neutral). Therapist skillfulness was measured using a
   five-point ordinal scale. Findings Relative to chance, therapist
   exploratory behaviors predicted subsequent client discussion of distal,
   drinking behavior {[}odds ratio (OR) = 1.37-1.78, P < 0.001] while
   suppressing discussion of proximal coping and neutral content (OR =
   0.83-0.90, P < 0.01). Unexpectedly, therapist teaching suppressed distal
   drinking language (OR = 0.48-0.53, P < 0.001) and predicted neutral
   content (OR = 1.45, P < 0.001). Connecting behaviors increased both
   drinking and coping language, particularly language in favor of change
   (CT OR = 1.15-1.84, P < 0.001). Analyses of exploring and connecting
   skillfulness revealed that high skillfulness maximized these behaviors
   effect on client responses, but not teaching skillfulness. Conclusions

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Understanding HCV transmission among people who
   inject drugs (PWID) is important for designing prevention strategies.
   This study investigated whether HCV infection among younger injectors
   occurs from few or many transmission events from older injectors to
   younger injectors among PWID in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: HCV antibody positive participants at enrolment or follow-up
   (1996-2012) were tested for HCV RNA and sequenced (Core-E2).
   Time-stamped phylogenetic trees were inferred using Bayesian
   Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST). Association of age with
   phylogeny was tested using statistics implemented in the software
   Bayesian Tip Significance (BaTS) testing. Factors associated with
   clustering (maximum cluster age: five years) were identified using
   logistic regression.
   Results: Among 699 participants with HCV subtype 1a, 1b, 2b and 3a
   infection (26\% female, 24\% HIV+): 21\% were younger (<27 years), and
   10\% had recent HCV seroconversion. When inferred cluster age was
   limited to <5 years, 15\% (n = 108) were in clusters/pairs. Although a
   moderate degree of segregation was observed between younger and older
   participants, there was also transmission between age groups. Younger
   age (<27 vs. >40, AOR: 3.14; 95\% CI: 1.54, 6.39), HIV (AOR: 1.97; 95\%
   CI: 1.22, 3.18) and subtype 3a (AOR: 2.12; 95\% CI: 1.33, 3.38) were
   independently associated with clustering.
   Conclusions: In this population of PWID from Vancouver, HCV among young
   injectors was seeded from many transmission events between HCV-infected
   older and younger injectors. Phylogenetic clustering was associated with
   younger age and HIV. These data suggest that HCV transmission among PWID
   is complex, with transmission occurring between and among older and
   younger PWID. (C) 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Abstract = {{The prevalence of both diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are
   reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Alarmingly, diabetes is also a
   risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The AD brain is characterised by
   the accumulation of peptides called A beta as plaques in the neuropil
   and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the form of neurofibrillary
   tangles within neurons. How diabetes confers risk is unknown but a
   simple linear relationship has been proposed whereby the
   hyperinsulinemia associated with type 2 diabetes leads to decreased
   insulin signaling in the brain, with downregulation of the PI3K/AKT
   signalling pathway and its inhibition of the major tau kinase, glycogen
   synthase kinase 3 beta. The earliest studies of post mortem AD brain
   tissue largely confirmed this cascade of events but subsequent studies
   have generally found either an upregulation of AKT activity, or that the
   relationship between insulin signaling and AD is independent of glycogen
   synthase kinase 3 beta altogether. Given the lack of success of
   beta-amyloid-reducing therapies in clinical trials, there is intense
   interest in finding alternative or adjunctive therapeutic targets for
   AD. Insulin signaling is a neuroprotective pathway and represents an
   attractive therapeutic option. However, this incredibly complex
   signaling pathway is not fully understood in the human brain and
   particularly in the context of AD. Here, we review the ups and downs of
   the research efforts aimed at understanding how diabetes modifies AD
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Influenza, the most important viral infection affecting
   older adults, produces a substantial burden in health care costs,
   morbidity, and mortality. Influenza vaccination remains the mainstay in
   prevention and is associated with reduced rates of hospitalization,
   stroke, heart attack, and death in non-institutional older adult
   populations. Influenza vaccination produces considerably lower antibody
   response in the elderly compared to young adults. Four-fold higher
   vaccine antigen (high-dose) than in the standard adult vaccine
   (standard-dose) elicits higher serum antibody levels and antibody
   response in ambulatory elderly.
   Purpose: To describe the design considerations of a large clinical trial
   of high-dose compared to standard-dose influenza vaccine in nursing
   homes and baseline characteristics of participating nursing homes and
   long-stay (more than 90 days) residents over 65 years of age.
   Methods: The high-dose influenza vaccine intervention trial is
   multifacility, cluster randomized controlled trial with a 232 factorial
   design that compares hospitalization rates, mortality, and functional
   decline among long-stay nursing home residents in facilities randomized
   to receive high-dose versus standard-dose influenza vaccine and also
   randomized with or without free staff vaccines provided by study
   organizers. Enrollment focused on nursing homes with a large long-stay
   resident population over 65 years of age. The primary outcome is the
   resident-level incidence of hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of
   pulmonary and influenza-like illness, based upon Medicare inpatient
   hospitalization claims. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality based
   upon the vital status indicator in the Medicare Vital Status file,
   all-cause hospitalization directly from the nursing home Minimum Data
   Set discharge records, and the probability of declining at least 4
   points on the 28-point Activities of Daily Living Scale.
   Results: Between February and September 2013, the high-dose influenza
   vaccine trial recruited and randomized 823 nursing homes. The analysis
   sample includes 53,035 long-stay nursing home residents over 65 years of
   age, representing 57.7\% of the participating facilities' population.
   Residents are mainly women (72.2\%), white (75.5\%), with a mean age of
   83 years. Common conditions include hypertension (79.2\%), depression
   (55.1\%), and diabetes mellitus (34.4\%). The prevalence of circulatory
   and pulmonary disorders includes heart failure (20.5\%), stroke
   (20.1\%), and asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20.2\%).
   Conclusions: This high-dose influenza vaccine trial uniquely offers a
   paradigm for future studies of clinical and programmatic interventions
   within the framework of efforts designed to test the impact of changes
   in usual treatment practices adopted by health care systems.}},

Abstract = {{Stratigraphic and structural mapping is important to understand the
   internal structure of sedimentary basins. Subsidence analysis provides
   significant insights for basin evolution. We designed a new software
   package to process and visualize stratigraphic setting and subsidence
   evolution of sedimentary basins from well data. BasinVis 1.0 is
   implemented in MATLAB (R), a multi-paradigm numerical computing
   environment, and employs two numerical methods: interpolation and
   subsidence analysis. Five different interpolation methods (linear,
   natural, cubic spline, Kriging, and thin-plate spline) are provided in
   this program for surface modeling. The subsidence analysis consists of
   decompaction and backstripping techniques. BasinVis 1.0 incorporates
   five main processing steps; (1) setup (study area and stratigraphic
   units), (2) loading well data, (3) stratigraphic setting visualization,
   (4) subsidence parameter input, and (5) subsidence analysis and
   visualization. For in-depth analysis, our software provides
   cross-section and dip-slip fault backstripping tools. The graphical user
   interface guides users through the workflow and provides tools to
   analyze and export the results. Interpolation and subsidence results are
   cached to minimize redundant computations and improve the interactivity
   of the program. All 2D and 3D visualizations are created by using MATLAB
   plotting functions, which enables users to fine-tune the results using
   the full range of available plot options in MATLAB. We demonstrate all
   functions in a case study of Miocene sediment in the central Vienna
   Basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
